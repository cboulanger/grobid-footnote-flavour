			<head>I. Introduction and Scope of the Essay<lb/></head>

			<p>The KlimaSeniorinnen case 1 has been widely and prominently discussed from the outset<lb/> of the proceedings. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> Each stage of the litigation efforts brought forward a large number<lb/> of commentators and critics. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Unsurprisingly, the long-awaited judgement of the ECtHR,<lb/> delivered on 9 April 2024, has already garnered a lot of attention, be it in the general<lb/> media <ref type="biblio">4</ref> or through academic outlets. <ref type="biblio">5<lb/></ref> In the following essay, I will briefly summarize the judgement and then focus on a few<lb/> issues that seem worth highlighting and to which I feel I can add substantial thoughts.<lb/></p>

			<p>These include considerations on aspects of strategic litigation in this case, the much-<lb/>1 ECtHR 09.04.2024, Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz / Switzerland, application no 53600/20 (references to<lb/> paragraphs without other specifications refer to this decision). The ECtHR issued its decisions on two other<lb/> climate cases on the same day: ECtHR 09.04.2024, Duarte Agostinho and Others / Portugal and 32 others,<lb/> application no 39371/20 (&quot;case of the Portugese children&quot;, declared inadmissible due to lack of jurisdiction and<lb/> lack of exhaustion of remedies relating to Portugal) and ECtHR 09.04.2024, Carême / France, application no<lb/> 7189/21 (&quot;case of the French Mayor&quot;, declared inadmissible due to lack of victim status). These decisions are not<lb/> discussed here.

			<head>II. Summary of Main Points of the Judgement<lb/></head>

			<p>The judgement in KlimaSeniorinnen originated in applications of the Verein<lb/> KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz (the association) and four women born between 1931 and<lb/> 1942 (applicants 2 to 5), all of which are members of the association 7 and complained of<lb/> severe health problems during climate-change-induced heat waves. 8 Applications to the<lb/> ECtHR were lodged in November 2020, 9 after requests to the national Swiss authorities to<lb/> take necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and comply with the Paris<lb/> agreements&apos; targets and the ensuing proceedings before the Swiss Federal Administrative<lb/> Court and the Swiss Federal Supreme Court were unsuccessful, as the applications were<lb/> considered inadmissible. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> In April 2022, the case was transferred to the jurisdiction of<lb/> the Grand Chamber, 11 together with two other pending climate cases. 12 A large number<lb/> of written third party comments were received, <ref type="biblio">13</ref></p>

			<p>The major part of the judgement deals with the alleged violations of Articles 2 and 8<lb/> ECHR. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> In this part of the judgement, the Court frames its legal assessment with<lb/> preliminary remarks and general considerations relating to climate-change cases. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> Here,<lb/> the court prominently states that &quot;climate change is one of the most pressing issues of<lb/> our time&quot; 17 and goes on to discuss, inter alia, the delicate task of ensuring compliance with<lb/> human rights obligations as an international court that has to be respectful of the<lb/> democratic legitimation of national governments and parliaments. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> The Court further<lb/> highlights the difficulties of attributing greenhouse gas emissions, the subsequent change<lb/> in climate and its consequences to specific sources <ref type="biblio">19</ref> and the resulting necessity of<lb/> polycentric measures to combat climate change. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Connected to this, the Court also<lb/> elaborates on the importance of intergenerational burden-sharing. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> All this serves the<lb/> Court to establish the need to depart from its existing environmental case-law, in order<lb/> to take into account the specificities of climate change and climate-change related cases. <ref type="biblio">22<lb/></ref> The Court then goes on to describe the effects of climate change on the enjoyment of<lb/> Convention rights broadly, relying heavily on the summaries of scientific evidence<lb/> prepared by the IPCC. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> It thus comes to the preliminary conclusion that climate change<lb/> &quot;poses a serious current and future threat to the enjoyment of human rights guaranteed<lb/> under the Convention, that States are aware of it and capable of taking measures to<lb/> effectively address it, that the relevant risks are projected to be lower if the rise in<lb/> temperature is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and if action is taken urgently,<lb/> and that current global mitigation efforts are not sufficient to meet the latter target&quot; 24 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Detailing the legitimate scope of its assessment, the Court then stresses that the ECHR<lb/> does not guarantee a right to a healthy environment, but environmental deterioration<lb/> may have a harmful effect on the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the Convention<lb/> 15 Para 296 to 576.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">16</ref> Para 410 ff and para 423 ff respectively.<lb/> 17 Para 410.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">18</ref> Para 412; see also para 449 f.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Para 416 ff. See also the considerations on causation and proof at para 424 ff and the discussion of the issue<lb/> of the proportion of State responsibility at para 441 ff.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Para 419.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">21</ref> Para 420.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">22</ref> Para 422.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">23</ref> Para 431 ff.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">24</ref> Para 436.<lb/></p>

			<p>(first and foremost: Article 8) and thus be relevant from the Convention&apos;s point of view. <ref type="biblio">25<lb/></ref> As the final general issue, the Court reiterates the principles regarding the interpretation<lb/> of the Convention as an international treaty established in its case-law. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> Here, the Court<lb/> stresses that the Convention &quot;should be interpreted, as far as possible, in harmony with<lb/> other rules of international law &quot; 27 .<lb/></p>

			<p>After these preliminary remarks, the Court assesses the admissibility of the applications<lb/> by connecting elaborations on the victim status of the applicants with the discussion of<lb/> the applicability of Articles 2 and 8 ECHR. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> At the outset, the Court stresses that the<lb/> concept of victim (Article 34 ECHR) &quot;must also be interpreted in an evolutive manner in<lb/> the light of conditions in contemporary society&quot; 29 and distinguishes categories of direct<lb/> victims, indirect victims and potential victims. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> The Court also differentiates between<lb/> victim status and locus standi, the latter in principle relating to the question of<lb/> representation of victims before the Court. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> Faced with the difficult task of delineating<lb/> the circle of victims in a way that makes the impact of climate-change on Convention rights<lb/> actionable but does not open up the Convention for an actio popularis, the Court finds<lb/> that the concept of &quot;potential victims&quot; is too broad and thus not suitable in climate-change<lb/> related cases. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> Instead, the Court establishes a relatively new test of level and severity of<lb/> the risk of adverse consequences and a pressing need to ensure the applicant&apos;s individual<lb/> 25 Para 445 ff.<lb/></p>

			<p>protection. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> The individual applicants in the case at hand, however, failed to meet this<lb/> criteria. <ref type="biblio">34<lb/></ref> The Court then goes on to elaborate on assessment criteria for the standing of<lb/> associations, <ref type="biblio">35</ref> highlighting the important role associations and other interest groups play<lb/> in a complex society faced with issues of intergenerational burden-sharing. <ref type="biblio">36</ref> The role of<lb/> these associations is also recognized in international instruments, most prominently the<lb/> Aarhus Convention, which the Court discusses in relative detail, also taking into account<lb/> the relevant domestic practice and the practice of the EU. <ref type="biblio">37</ref> This leads the Court to<lb/> conclude that &quot;the special feature of climate change as a common concern of humankind<lb/> and the necessity of promoting intergenerational burden-sharing in this context […] speak<lb/> in favour of recognising the standing of associations before the Court in climate-change<lb/> cases&quot; 38 . This locus standi is independent of the victim status of an association&apos;s<lb/> members. <ref type="biblio">39</ref> In order to exclude the possibility of actio popularis, the Court then finds it<lb/> necessary to devise a test for standing of associations, which it develops by taking into<lb/> account the principles of the Aarhus Convention. <ref type="biblio">40</ref> This test of locus standi is met by an<lb/> association that is: &quot;(a) lawfully established in the jurisdiction concerned or have standing<lb/> to act there; (b) able to demonstrate that it pursues a dedicated purpose in accordance<lb/> with its statutory objectives in the defence of the human rights of its members or other<lb/> affected individuals within the jurisdiction concerned, whether limited to or including<lb/> collective action for the protection of those rights against the threats arising from climate<lb/> change; and (c) able to demonstrate that it can be regarded as genuinely qualified and<lb/> representative to act on behalf of members or other affected individuals within the<lb/> 33 Para 486 ff. As for the relationship of these new criteria to the relatively established criteria to test whether<lb/> Article 8 is applicable in environmental cases (actual interference or serious risk) see para 520.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">34</ref> Para 533, 536.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Para 489 ff.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">36</ref> Confirmed also in para 497 f, with specific focus on climate change litigation.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">37</ref> Para 490 ff.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">38</ref> Para 499.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">39</ref> Para 502, but see 503: &quot;In the event of existing limitations regarding the standing before the domestic courts<lb/> of associations meeting the above Convention requirements, the Court may also, in the interests of the proper<lb/> administration of justice, take into account whether, and to what extent, its individual members or other affected<lb/> individuals may have enjoyed access to a court in the same or related domestic proceedings.&quot;<lb/> 40 Para 501.<lb/></p>

			<p>jurisdiction who are subject to specific threats or adverse effects of climate change on<lb/> their lives, health or well-being as protected under the Convention&quot; 41 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Having laid out these criteria, the Court goes on to assess the applicability of Articles 2<lb/> and 8 ECHR. Regarding Article 2, the Court reiterates that this provision is applicable only<lb/> in cases of real and imminent risks to life, 42 which according to the Court is not the case<lb/> in view of the individual applicants. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> Regarding the association, the Court does not make<lb/> a final decision on whether it meets these conditions, but chooses to examine only Article<lb/> 8 in detail. <ref type="biblio">44</ref> Regarding the applicability of Article 8, the Court holds that &quot;Article 8 must be<lb/> seen as encompassing a right for individuals to effective protection by the State<lb/> authorities from serious adverse effects of climate change on their life, health, well-being<lb/> and quality of life.&quot; <ref type="biblio">45</ref> The Court then refers back to the criteria established for locus standi<lb/> of associations, which are met by the applicant association. <ref type="biblio">46</ref> The individual applicants do<lb/> not fulfil the criteria for victim status with regard to Article 8, according to the Court. <ref type="biblio">47<lb/></ref> Having established the admissibility of the association&apos;s application (and the<lb/> inadmissibility of the individual applications), the Court goes on to elaborate on the merits<lb/> of the case regarding Article 8. <ref type="biblio">48</ref> Here, the Court highlights the existing margin of<lb/> appreciation, but also emphasizes the procedural safeguards established in its case-law,<lb/> such as States having to rely on appropriate scientific evidence made available to the<lb/> public. <ref type="biblio">49</ref> The Court then goes on to find that &quot;climate protection should carry considerable<lb/> weight in the weighing-up of any competing considerations&quot;, 50 and becomes even more<lb/> precise by stating that Article 8 in principle demands Contracting States to reach net<lb/> neutrality within the next three decades. <ref type="biblio">51</ref> This principle is accompanied by specific<lb/> procedural safeguards, such as the duty to adopt general measures specifying a timeline<lb/> 41 Para 502.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">42</ref></p>

 Para 513.<lb/> 43 Para 533, 536.<lb/> 44 Para 536.<lb/> 45 Para 519.<lb/> 46 Para 521 ff.<lb/> 47 Para 527 ff.<lb/> 48 Para 538.<lb/> 49 Para 539 ff.<lb/> 50 Para 542.<lb/> 51 Para 548.<lb/></figure>

			<p>First, one can look at the judgement itself. On the one hand, looking at the outcome for<lb/> the individual applicants and the way the Court detailed the conditions of victim status,<lb/> not everyone might view this judgement as a success. On the other hand, the novel<lb/> approach to locus standi of associations is definitively a win from the perspective of<lb/> associations active in the field of climate litigation. Given the objective of the applications,<lb/> which aimed at remedying the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human<lb/> rights through both individual and collective means, the judgement can be qualified as a<lb/> partial &quot;win&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>Second, and much harder, one can try to evaluate the impact the judgement will have for<lb/> advancing climate protection. Here, it is definitively noteworthy that the Court used the<lb/> opportunities it had to highlight the imminent danger climate change holds for the<lb/> enjoyment and protection of human rights. The Court did not shy away from making quite<lb/> general statements with potentially far-reaching consequences, such as regarding the<lb/> weighing of climate protection interests and States&apos; obligation to mitigate greenhouse gas<lb/> emissions and strive for net neutrality. <ref type="biblio">69</ref> Looking at the case-law of the Court more<lb/> broadly, the elaboration of procedural safeguards based on which the Court will evaluate<lb/> States&apos; compliance with the Convention guarantees was to be expected and is in line with<lb/> the general trend towards procedural control. <ref type="biblio">70</ref> What is surprising, however, is the detail<lb/> in which the Court lays down these procedural safeguards. Ultimately, however, the<lb/> impact all these requirements will have on climate protection &quot;on the ground&quot; depends<lb/> on the willingness of States 71 to comply with them swiftly. <ref type="biblio">72</ref> Here, reference to the partly<lb/> concurring, partly dissenting opinion of Judge Eicke is due: He appears to be very sceptic<lb/> <ref type="biblio">69</ref> As to the preciseness of this obligation see Hilson/Geden, Climate or carbon neutrality? Which one must states<lb/> aim for under Article 8 ECHR?, EJIL:Talk!, 29.04.2024, https://www.ejiltalk.org/climate-or-carbon-neutrality-<lb/>which-one-must-states-aim-for-under-article-8-echr/.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">70</ref></p>

			<p>as to whether judgements of the ECtHR (and, it seems, courts in general) are a suitable<lb/> means to compel States to the urgent action needed to combat the climate crisis. <ref type="biblio">73</ref> This<lb/> criticism has some truth to it insofar as it acknowledges that courts alone may not be able<lb/> to exert the pressure that is (obviously) needed to initiate and drive transformative policy.<lb/></p>

			<p>What is left out of the picture in this position is, however, that strategic litigation is usually<lb/> part of a bigger strategy to advocate for social change. Court judgements can help to<lb/> legitimize this advocacy efforts, especially when these judgements refer to human rights<lb/> argumentation. <ref type="biblio">74</ref> As such, these judgements may help to put topics like climate change<lb/> back on the political agenda and shift policy-makers&apos; attention and priorities.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lastly, one can ask whether the Court itself acted strategically when devising the<lb/> judgement. Commentators have called the judgement &quot;tainted by [the] objective of<lb/> judicial self-preservation&quot;, as the Court did not consider in depth the claims brought<lb/> forward relating to intergenerational equity, <ref type="biblio">75</ref> which is even more obvious in view of the<lb/> Duarte 76 case. Nevertheless, the Court did introduce standing for NGOs and thus allowed<lb/> for a range of future cases, probably also bringing up (again) intergenerational issues.<lb/></p>

			<head>B. Standing for Associations<lb/></head>

			<p>One of the major novelties within the KlimaSeniorinnen judgement is the Court&apos;s<lb/> approach to associations and their opportunities to access the Court. <ref type="biblio">77</ref> The Court<lb/> introduced a novel concept of locus standi of associations, independent of the victim<lb/> 73 Eicke, para 69.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">74</ref> For the strategic orientation of the KlimaSeniorinnen case and the narratives employed cf Keller/Bornemann,<lb/> New Climate Activism between Politics and Law: Analyzing the Strategy of the KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz, Politics<lb/> and Governance 9:2 (2021) 124 (128 f, 131); highlighting the intersectionality of the approach: Sußner,<lb/> Intersektionalität als Strategie: Der Fall KlimaSeniorinnen v. Switzerland, Zeitschrift des deutschen<lb/> Juristinnenbundes (2023) 74 ff; Jong, Beyond the turn to human rights: a call for an intersectional climate justice<lb/> approach, The International Journal of Human Rights 28:5 (2024), 738 ff; Hefti, Intersectional Victims as Agents<lb/> of Change in International Human Rights-Based Climate Litigation, Transnational Environmental Law (2024) 1 ff.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">75</ref> Brucher/De Spiegeleir, The European Court of Human Rights&apos; April 9 Climate Rulings and the Future (Thereof),<lb/> Verfassungsblog, 29.04.2024, https://verfassungsblog.de/the-european-court-of-human-rights-april-9-climate-<lb/>rulings-and-the-future-thereof/.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">76</ref> ECtHR 09.04.2024, Duarte Agostinho and Others / Portugal and 32 others, application no 39371/20.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">77</ref> Cf also Wende, Das KlimaSeniorinnen-Urteil des EGMR -Was ist neu daran?, EnergieKrise-Aktuell (2024)<lb/> 010346.<lb/></p>

			<p>status of their members. In doing so, the Court went beyond was what initially conceived<lb/> of as possible by the claimants. <ref type="biblio">78<lb/></ref> The main justification for this new approach stems from the specificities of the climate<lb/> crisis and the resulting harms. <ref type="biblio">79</ref> In order to ensure that claims alleging human rights<lb/> violations due to lack of climate change mitigation can reach the Court without allowing<lb/> for actio popularis, the Court found it necessary to develop its case-law in the fashion<lb/> described above in the summary section.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given that locus standi is the most obvious novelty, it is unsurprising that this aspect has<lb/> received a major part of scholarly attention and criticism. In Line with Judge Eicke, scholars<lb/> criticise the ECtHR for overstepping the boundaries of the explicit provisions of the<lb/> Convention, 80 namely Article 34 ECHR that reads: &quot;The Court may receive applications<lb/> from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be<lb/> the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the<lb/> Convention or the protocols thereto.&quot; Critics argue that Article 34 ECHR demands a direct<lb/> link between the applicant and the alleged violation of human rights.<lb/> However, as the Court has pointed out, the terms of the Convention are usually<lb/> interpreted as being part of a living document that evolves with the changing of<lb/> circumstances. It is not unusual, then, that one and the same word (in this case: victim)<lb/> has more than one meaning and is shaped into different categories of meaning. In the<lb/> specific climate change context, the Court has argued that the &quot;classic&quot; victim concepts<lb/> lead to a lack of enforceability of human rights and thus developed a new approach,<lb/> consisting in the privileged position of associations meeting certain criteria to bring<lb/> applications. This new approach is in line with the development in international law and<lb/> practice, <ref type="biblio">81</ref> where associations -mostly: environmental NGOs -are increasingly relied on<lb/> as an important pillar of civil society. <ref type="biblio">82</ref> The most relevant document in this regard is the<lb/> Aarhus Convention, <ref type="biblio">83</ref> which qualifies environmental NGOs as important part of civil<lb/> society. <ref type="biblio">84<lb/></ref> Here, it is interesting to note that the Court found climate-change litigation not to be<lb/> covered by the Aarhus Convention. This is true only insofar as legislative acts or emissions<lb/> are concerned, as legislators and courts do not fall under the Aarhus Convention&apos;s<lb/> definition of &quot;public authority&quot; <ref type="biblio">85</ref> . Whilst the Court dealt with exactly these legislative<lb/> omissions, legislation and executive measures often mix when it comes to climate<lb/> mitigation, and effective climate mitigation does in many cases depend on implementing<lb/> executive regulations. In these cases, the Aarhus Convention is directly applicable. There,<lb/> it will be interesting to observe if and how the criteria established by the Court for<lb/> associations to have standing will converge with the criteria established under the Aarhus<lb/> Convention and within implementing domestic legislation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to this, looking at the quite broad thematic scope of the Aarhus Convention<lb/> highlights another issue of the Court&apos;s new approach: Is locus standi of associations limited<lb/> to human rights based climate litigation only? Whilst the climate crisis is definitively one<lb/> of the most pressing global challenges, the climate is only one of the planetary boundaries<lb/> relevant for sustaining a liveable planet. <ref type="biblio">86</ref> Whilst it might be much less evident or<lb/> imminent that human rights violations could result from a loss of biodiversity or the<lb/> acidification of the oceans, it is not unconceivable to argue that these issues also pose a<lb/> threat to human rights (mainly: Article 2 and 8 ECHR). In addition to that, even if locus<lb/> standi of association might be granted for climate litigation cases only, a very broad range<lb/> of legislation is, in fact, relevant for reaching set climate targets. <ref type="biblio">87<lb/></ref> C. The Literal Costs of KlimaSeniorinnen -Justice is Not Accessible For All<lb/> Another issue worth highlighting are the literal costs of KlimaSeniorinnen. Altogether, the<lb/> applicant association claimed expenses of roughly EUR 715.000, only CHF 9.000 of which<lb/> were costs imposed by the Swiss Courts at domestic level. <ref type="biblio">88</ref> The Court deemed only a<lb/> fraction of these costs as necessarily incurred and awarded EUR 80.000 to the applicant<lb/> association. <ref type="biblio">89<lb/></ref> Whilst it is speculative to consider whether the case would have been equally successful<lb/> with less or less expensive legal advice, it is nevertheless obvious that the litigation<lb/> strategy employed by KlimaSeniorinnen was costly. It has been pointed out in the<lb/> literature that the efforts were only made possible through Greenpeace&apos;s financial<lb/> support. <ref type="biblio">90</ref> This of course begs the question whether the Court unwillingly opened up the<lb/> door for a very elitist climate litigation scene, allowing only associations with a very stable<lb/> financial background to bring claims of human rights violations resulting from lacking<lb/> climate change mitigation. Whilst this allegation might have some truth to it, one has to<lb/> keep in mind that access to justice in general is usually a privilege of the few, not the reality<lb/> of the many. <ref type="biblio">91</ref> Taking human rights disputes to the ECtHR is a lengthy process, demanding<lb/> not only from a financial perspective, but also time-wise, psychologically and mentally.<lb/> This is even more so with prominent cases, where applicants are under the critical eye of<lb/> the public (sometimes also: seek media attention to further their case).<lb/></p>

			<head>IV. Changing Legal Opportunity Structures; Opportunities Yet to<lb/> be Seized<lb/></head>

			<p>The KlimaSeniorinnen judgement can be qualified as revolutionary as it 97 brings about<lb/> major changes for the position of associations and their opportunities to challenge<lb/> human rights violations caused by insufficient climate mitigation measures. Given that<lb/> this is a new development, it is unsurprising and not uncommon for this new doctrine to<lb/> come with some unanswered questions. These questions relate, inter alia, to the<lb/> applicability of the doctrine (whether &quot;only&quot; in climate litigation cases or beyond) and the<lb/> precise criteria associations must fulfil to be granted standing. It remains to be seen how<lb/> this development will impact domestic legal opportunity structures 98 and ensuing climate<lb/> litigation. As of yet, restrictive admissibility criteria often hinder substantive decisions on<lb/> climate issues at the domestic level. <ref type="biblio">99<lb/></ref> From a substantive perspective, the Court developed its environmental case-law<lb/> coherently, taking into account the specificities of the climate crisis. A strong focus was<lb/> placed on procedural safeguards, which the Court derived from Article 8 ECHR. According<lb/> to the Court, Article 8 ECHR imposes a general obligation of Contracting States to<lb/> &quot;undertake measures for the substantial and progressive reduction of their respective<lb/> GHG emission levels, with a view to reaching net neutrality within, in principle, the next<lb/> three decades&quot; 100 .<lb/> <ref type="biblio">97</ref> As the ambiguity of the title of this essay might already suggest to some readers, it is justified to see both the<lb/> ECtHR and the association KlimaSeniorinnen (as well as the many individuals involved in the litigation efforts)<lb/> as drivers of the resulting change in legal opportunity structures.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">98</ref></p>
