			<p>When the PEQF was introduced, one of the underlying drivers for the reform of the<lb/> police entry routes was to increase the professionalization of the police service in<lb/> England and Wales. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> A central component of this professionalization drive was and<lb/> remains to harness and nurture the capacity for police officers to think independently<lb/> and critically. The salience attached to critical thinking is directly connected to the new<lb/> approach of collaborative teaching and, in particular, the inclusion of universities in<lb/> the delivery of police training. As McCanney, Taylor and Bates note, &apos;[i]t is claimed<lb/> that graduate entry will ensure that recruits possess critical thinking skills enabling<lb/> them to make autonomous decisions by assessing and balancing complex risks. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> A<lb/> move intended to elevate policing to a profession.&apos; <ref type="biblio">11</ref> This reflects the view that a<lb/> degree of &apos;graduateness&apos; of the university experience empowers police constables with<lb/> the critical thinking that higher-level education helps cultivate. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> In their study,<lb/> McCanney, Taylor and Bates set out to determine whether opportunities existed for<lb/> graduate officers to find the &apos;discretionary space&apos; to employ skills associated with<lb/> university study. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Surveying 234 police constables, their analysis revealed that<lb/> officers faced barriers to decision-making from bureaucratic and managerial<lb/></p>

			<p>procedures. The conclusion reached was that police organisations may need to make<lb/> changes structurally and procedurally to benefit from a graduate workforce. Yet, in<lb/> seeking to identify this &apos;discretionary space&apos;, the authors assume that critical faculties<lb/> have been developed, the central issue now becoming whether space is afforded to<lb/> put these skills into practice. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> The extent to which the objectives of developing critical<lb/> thinkers can be achieved through the PEQF is, however, contested. Lambert, for<lb/> instance, has been critical of the apprentice degrees in general in that only a minimum<lb/> 900 hours of learning is required compared to 3,600 hours of a full degree leading to<lb/> &apos;misleading&apos; claims for the student&apos;s achievements. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Others assess that there is an<lb/> urgent need for a proper theory of change and the design of logic models to guide the<lb/> design and implementation of the three training routes under the PEQF. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> Some are<lb/> more reserved in their assessment.

			<head>From Banking Models to Problem Solving Models of Education Freire&apos;s: Pedagogy<lb/> of the Oppressed<lb/></head>

			<p>The starting point for this article is a degree of skepticism surrounding the potential<lb/> for the PEQF to harness critical thinking. Based on experience delivering teaching to<lb/> police recruits, a useful way to think about and conceptualise the challenges faced is<lb/> offered through the banking approach to education as articulated by Paulo Freire.<lb/></p>

			<p>Freire was a Brazilian educator and philosopher who was a leading advocate of critical<lb/> pedagogy. His approach to pedagogy emerged from his observations and experiences<lb/> working as an instructor in literacy programs with peasant labourers in Brazil. In his<lb/> classic text-the pedagogy of the oppressed-he critiqued what he terms the banking<lb/> model of education. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> This form of delivery involves an individual-usually a teacher-<lb/>reciting facts and ideas to a group of students who are required to listen and memorize<lb/> the content. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> Freire identified a distinctlack of connectivity between the content and<lb/> people&apos;s real lives; the banking model is built on the fact that the teacher knows all,<lb/> and there exist inferiors that must just accept what they are told:<lb/></p>

			<p>The teacher talks about reality as if it were motionless, static,<lb/> compartmentalized, and predictable. Or else he expounds on a topic<lb/> completely alien to the existential experience of the students. His task is to &quot;fill&quot;<lb/> the students with the contents of his narration-contents which are detached<lb/> from reality, disconnected from the totality that engendered them and could<lb/> give them significance. Words are emptied of their concreteness and become a<lb/> hollow, alienated, and alienating verbosity. <ref type="biblio">20<lb/></ref> This approach to pedagogy, according to Freire, is a form of oppression. He reasoned<lb/> that it encouraged students to just accept what is thrust upon them as correct. Freire<lb/> concluded that if students are trained to be passive listeners, they will never be able<lb/> to come to the realization that there even exists oppressors. While Freire champions a<lb/> problem-solving model to overcome oppression, the banking model approach to<lb/> teaching is evident in police education and, it is suggested here, a significant barrier<lb/> to the very objective of critical thinking that the PEQF purports to achieve. While there<lb/> is a range of factors that limit the scope for critical thinking in the PEQF context, the<lb/> complexity of the legal landscape and the magnitude of content covered in the<lb/> National Police Curriculum (NPC) provide two useful demonstrations of the creep of<lb/> banking model in this context. The discussion below briefly unpacks both to elucidate<lb/> the need for creativity within the confines set by the framework when attempting to<lb/> deliver police training.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Ibid., at 71.<lb/></p>

			<head>The legal Landscape<lb/></head>

			<p>Upon entering the profession, police recruits are required to engage with a complex<lb/> mix of legal and non-legal sources so that, by the end of their training, they are in a<lb/> position to know and apply the law, often in circumstances, which do not permit prior<lb/> reflection and contemplation. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> Moreover, they must also know and apply the law in<lb/> ways that are compliant with human rights, reflecting the fact that the police are a<lb/> public authority pursuant to section 6 of the Human Rights Act, 1998. The scale of this<lb/> task is evident when considering the multiple sources of law in England and Wales.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firstly, the law can be found in primary legislation, such as the Police and Criminal<lb/> Evidence Act (PACE), 1984. As just one piece of legislation, PACE 1984 comprises 11<lb/> parts, 7 schedules, and 122 provisions. Many of the provisions are themselves highly<lb/> complex, involving layers of legal jargon and statutory semantics. Despite the<lb/> complexity of PACE, it is, however, but one statute. Regarding most areas that engage<lb/> the police in some form, it is rare that just one piece of legislation is applicable. In<lb/></p>

			<figure>relation to stop and search, for example, powers are also included in the Misuse of<lb/> Drugs Act, 1971, the Firearms Act, 1968, and the Psychoactive Substances Act, 2016,<lb/> as examples. Furthermore, different pieces of legislation place different requirements<lb/> on the use of this power. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994,<lb/> for instance, contains a power which allows officers to search without reasonable<lb/> 21 Peter Leyland, (2021), The Constitution of the United Kingdom: A Contextual Analysis. Bloomsbury.<lb/></figure>

			<p>grounds, sometimes known as &apos;no suspicion&apos; or &apos;section 60&apos; search. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> The law is also<lb/> included in secondary legislation, which is law created by ministers (or other bodies)<lb/> under powers given to them by an Act of Parliament. The parent Act of Parliament<lb/> will specify the body or person who power has been delegated to by Parliament.<lb/></p>

			<p>Often, secondary legislation is used to fill in the details of primary legislation. These<lb/> details provide practical measures that enable the law to be enforced and operate in<lb/> daily life. Police powers have also been developed by the courts. For instance, the<lb/> police have powers of both entry and arrest to prevent a breach of the peace. However,<lb/> an individual officer wishing to ascertain both the existence and scope of these powers<lb/> will not find such authority in the statute books. Rather, they will instead be required<lb/> to engage with court judgements as contained in such databases as Westlaw UK,<lb/> LexisNexis or British and Irish Legal Information Institute. Further complicating<lb/> matters, case law can also be used to develop the scope and contours of primary and<lb/> secondary legislation through a process of statutory interpretation. For the police<lb/> recruit keen to understand the particular contours of these more specific provisions,<lb/> the jurisprudence of English courts, formed as a result of judicial statutory<lb/> interpretation, often &apos;puts meat on the bones&apos; of bare legal provisions. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> In addition to<lb/> these primary sources of law, recruits are also required to engage with a number of<lb/> additional sources-what we might call soft law. As an example, the College of Policing<lb/> (CoP) assumes the responsibility for issuing &apos;codes of practice&apos; to Chief Constables.<lb/> These codes of practice are issued under section 39A of the Police Act 1996 (as<lb/> amended) and therefore have a statutory footing. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> A prominent example of such a<lb/> code is the Code of Ethics, which compliments the policing standards of professional<lb/> behaviour. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> The Code of Ethics sets out the policing principles that members of the<lb/></p>

			<figure>police service are expected to uphold and the standards of behaviour they are<lb/> expected to meet. Many forces have their own values statements, which are<lb/> complementary to the Code of Ethics. Sometimes specific legislation requires the<lb/> government to publish guidance on a specific set of powers. For example, part IV of<lb/> the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires the government to publish and<lb/> maintain codes of practice on the powers in the Act (what are known as the PACE<lb/> Codes). Regarding Stop and Search Powers, for instance, the relevant Code of Practice<lb/> is Code A (Home Office, 2015). The College of Policing also publishes Authorised<lb/> Professional Practice (APP) documents. 26 These documents are themed around<lb/> different aspects of policing, advise police staff on how to use their powers lawfully<lb/> and effectively, and are designed to support the training and development of police<lb/> personnel. The police are expected to &apos;have regard&apos; to APP guidance whilst on duty.<lb/> In 2020, the College of Policing updated its Authorised Professional Practice for stop<lb/> 24 See Jessica Brown, &apos;Police powers: an introduction&apos; [17 June 2020], House of Commons Library Briefing<lb/> Paper, Number 8637.<lb/> 25 College of Policing.

			<p>and search in respect of public engagement. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> There is, furthermore, scope for<lb/> voluntary guidelines and best practice. For instance, the Home Office has published<lb/> guidance on the Best Use of Stop and Search Powers. This is a voluntary scheme,<lb/> which all forces have signed up to, the legislation has not been amended.<lb/></p>

			<head>The Police National Curriculum<lb/></head>

			<p>Another significant challenge facing the goal of creating critically thinking recruits is<lb/> one that derives from the excessive and unrealistic scope of the National Police<lb/></p>

			<figure>Curriculum (NPC). The NPC comprises learning standards which have been designed<lb/> to meet policing needs. Each of the learning standards is fully mapped to the<lb/> aforementioned Authorised Professional Practice, as well as to relevant National<lb/> Occupational Standards contained within the Policing Professional Framework. The<lb/> curriculum consists of approximately 23 thematic headings (see box 1).<lb/> Box 1: Themes Addressed in the National Police Curriculum<lb/> Understanding the Police Constable Role<lb/> Valuing Difference and Inclusion<lb/> Maintaining Professional Standards<lb/> Evidence-based Policing<lb/> Problem Solving<lb/> 27 College of Policing, Stop and search, Stop and search (college.police.uk)<lb/> Each of these specific themes has several learning outcomes. For instance, the learning<lb/> outcomes for managing conflict are as follows:<lb/> Box 2: Examples of PNC Learning Outcomes<lb/> 1. Examine the theories and models underpinning the causes of conflict within<lb/> policing interventions<lb/> 2. Explain the types of situations where conflict may occur and the appropriate<lb/> response<lb/> 3. Analyse the ethical and moral implications of the police using force<lb/> 4. Identify levels of tension within a conflict situation<lb/> 5. Describe the process for determining whether the use of force is necessary in a<lb/> conflict situation<lb/> 6. Examine alternatives to using force when involved in a conflict situation<lb/> 7. Employ personal protection skills within a conflict situation<lb/> 8. Effectively use personal protection equipment, physical and mechanical<lb/> restraints<lb/> 9. Effectively use personal safety skills as determined by the specific role of the<lb/> officer or designated operating environment<lb/> 10. Account for, and justify the use of force in a conflict situation<lb/> Each learning outcome then disaggregates further to encompass a range of what is<lb/> known as minimum core content-the bare minimum that each learning outcome must<lb/> achieve. These are specific aspects that must be addressed. If we-Effectively use<lb/> personal protection equipment, physical and mechanical restraints-the MCC are as<lb/> follows:<lb/> Box 3: Example of PNC Minimum Core Content<lb/> 1. Use of an authorised issue baton<lb/> 2. Use of an authorised incapacitant spray, including the effects of such usage and<lb/> aftercare requirements<lb/> 3. Application of physical and mechanical restraints<lb/> 4. Multi-officer techniques<lb/> 5. Possible medical implications following use of restraints and personal safety<lb/> equipment<lb/> 6. How to evaluate the use of personal protection equipment<lb/> Thus, notwithstanding the aspirations of the PEQF to develop and harness critical<lb/> thinking police officers, the NPC is, to put it mildly, &apos;very prescriptive about what<lb/></figure>

			<p>should be taught and as a result of this prescriptive nature <ref type="biblio">[and]</ref> this could prevent all<lb/> the benefits of higher education being accessed by the students who undertake these<lb/> programmes.&apos; <ref type="biblio">28</ref> The reality that emerges is that police recruits enter the PEQF process<lb/> often with little experience in dealing with the law. The law in England and Wales is<lb/> itself highly complex and multi-tiered, deriving from the constitutional set-up of the<lb/> UK and includes primary and secondary law, common law and judge developed law,<lb/> in addition to a range of additional standards, codes and guidelines. Given the scope<lb/> of police powers and responsibilities, this complex web or information is replicated<lb/> and repeated across different law-related topics, which include but are not limited to<lb/> powers of arrest; entry, search, and seizure; detention and questioning;<lb/> counterterrorism; public protection; and public order, as examples. Added to this,<lb/> police recruits must also engage in a range of non-law topics as defined in the College<lb/> of Policing Curriculum.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is the sheer scale and complexity of the task that necessitates a banking approach to<lb/> education. Yet, paradoxically, it is this approach which severely limits the extent to<lb/> which the critical faculties of the recipients are developed. The question that emerges,<lb/> therefore, is how those responsible for delivering police training can cover the<lb/> necessary content while doing so in a manner that cultivates the overarching goal of<lb/> harnessing critical thinking? Against this backdrop, the remainder of this article<lb/> articulates a human rights-based approach to teaching police about their powers. It<lb/> utilizes insights from Paulo Freire&apos;s Pedagogy of the oppressed as the theoretical<lb/> framework.<lb/></p>

			<head>Towards a problem-solving approach and human rights<lb/></head>

			<p>In response to the limitations of the banking model, Freire urges the adoption of the<lb/> problem-posing model. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> This approach to education encourages a discussion<lb/> between teacher and student. It is, in essence, a method of teaching that promotes<lb/> critical thinking for the purpose of liberation and depends on students as co-creators<lb/> in the delivery of teaching. The distinction between the two was summarised by Freire<lb/> in the following way:<lb/></p>

			<p>[Banking education] attempts, by mythicizing reality, to conceal certain facts<lb/> which explain the way men exist in the worldâ€¦. Banking education resists<lb/> dialogue; problem-posing education regards dialogue as indispensable to the<lb/> act of cognition which unveils reality. Banking education treats students as<lb/> objects of assistance; problem-posing education makes them critical thinkersâ€¦.<lb/></p>

			<p>Problem-posing education bases itself on creativity and stimulates true<lb/> reflection and action upon reality, thereby responding to the vocation of men<lb/> as beings who are authentic only when engaged in inquiry and creative<lb/> transformation. <ref type="biblio">30<lb/></ref> The problem-solving model seeks to blur the distinction between teacher and students<lb/> as everyone learns alongside each other, creating equality. A problem-solving<lb/> approach relies on the constructivist theory, which holds that knowledge is<lb/> <ref type="biblio">29</ref> See Freire (n. 16), chapter 2.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Ibid., at 83.<lb/> constructed by individuals by using their experiences, which is what Freire drew upon<lb/> in developing his pedagogy. In Pedagogy of the Oppressed Freire wrote:<lb/> Education as the practice of freedom-as opposed to education as the practice<lb/> of domination-denies that man is abstract, isolated, independent, and<lb/> unattached to the world; it also denies that the world exists as a reality apart<lb/> from people. Authentic reflection considers neither abstract man nor the world<lb/> without people, but people in their relations with the world. <ref type="biblio">31<lb/></ref> The starting point for a human rights-based approach to teaching is not to view human<lb/> rights as yet another layer to heap onto an already overwhelming pile of existing hard<lb/> and soft law. Instead, it seeks to channel and harness the nature of rights contestation<lb/> and the competing obligations that police officers must attempt to balance. This is<lb/> achieved by asking police recruits, in line with a discursive approach, to think about<lb/> the types of rights issues that a particular police power affects. In Pedagogy of the<lb/> Oppressed, Freire insisted that dialogical encounters help students to develop a<lb/> critical consciousness of social, political, and economic contradictions so that they can<lb/> take action against them. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> In the context of police powers, however, this dialogical<lb/> exercise can help provide a lens through which to examine legislation. In conformity<lb/> with Freire&apos;s problem-solving approach, the central objective is to develop critical<lb/> thinking. This is done primarily by exploring the nature of competing rights<lb/> obligations that police officers, as public servants possess by drawing on the<lb/> perspectives and views of police recruits. Understanding these competing claims to<lb/> rights requires officers to draw on their own experience and knowledge in order to<lb/> question how police powers might relate to the safeguarding of human rights.<lb/></p>

			<p>Let us take a number of rights in turn by examining the stop and search powers under<lb/> the PACE, 1984. Section 1 of PACE 1984 allows an officer to search a person or vehicle,<lb/> or anything in or on a vehicle if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that stolen<lb/> or prohibited articles, bladed or sharply pointed articles, or prohibited fireworks will<lb/> be found. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Not only is the use of stop and search one of the most controversial of<lb/> police powers, it is also an area that illuminates gaps in police knowledge of the law.<lb/></p>

			<p>For instance, a 2013 Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) report<lb/> examined police compliance with the law in respect of stop and search. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> The findings<lb/> raised &apos;concerns about the differing views among officers of what constitutes<lb/> reasonable grounds for suspicion, [and raised] questions about the levels of training<lb/> provided to officers and supervisors, and about how they develop a practical<lb/> understanding of reasonable grounds for suspicion. <ref type="biblio">35</ref> The report also concluded that<lb/> &apos;[t]raining should be improved so that officers better understand, amongst other<lb/> things, what constitutes reasonable grounds.&apos; <ref type="biblio">36</ref> In 2016, as part of the HMIC&apos;s report<lb/> <ref type="biblio">33</ref> The items referred to reflect the scope of material which is covered under Part 1 PACE, 1984. Other pieces of<lb/> legislation are concerned with different items. As examples, Section 23 Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971-search for<lb/> controlled drugs; Section 47 Firearms Act, 1968-possession of a firearm; and Section 36 Psychoactive<lb/> Substances Act, 2016-Legal Highs.<lb/> 34 HMIC (n. 37)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Ibid., at 29.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">36</ref> Ibid.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another is that where police officers stop and search an individual who is in<lb/> possession of stolen goods and where these goods belong to an individual whose<lb/> home has just been robbed, the use of the power can be justified from the perspective<lb/> of protecting the right to property. From an operational perspective, the use of stop<lb/> and search can, in theory, be a significant tool in the armour of the police, one which,<lb/> depending on the circumstances can protect individual rights and the interests of<lb/> society more generally. According to Code A of PACE Act 1984, the power enables<lb/> officers to allay or confirm suspicions about individuals without exercising their<lb/> power of arrest. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> More concretely, the power can be used, amongst other things, to<lb/> prevent crime, investigate crime, and detect crime. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> This initial discussion opens<lb/> recruits&apos; minds to interrogating why certain powers are there, what purpose they<lb/> serve and how these powers might relate to human rights issues.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the same time, the use of stop and search can undermine rights in various ways.<lb/></p>

			<p>The most consequential impact of the use of stop and search has been the<lb/> disproportionate use of the power against the Black community and ethnic<lb/> minorities. <ref type="biblio">44</ref> In 1999, for instance, the MacPherson report into the death of Stephen<lb/> Lawrence, while not focusing on stop and search specifically, found that institutional<lb/> racism was apparent in the disproportionate use of stop and search against black<lb/> people. <ref type="biblio">45</ref> In 2010, the Equality and Human Rights Commission concluded that if you<lb/> are a black person, you are at least six times as likely to be stopped and searched by<lb/> the police in England and Wales as a white person. <ref type="biblio">46</ref> In 2013, Her Majesty&apos;s<lb/> Inspectorate of Constabulary found that of the 8,783 stop and search records<lb/> examined, 27% did not include sufficient grounds to justify the lawful use of the<lb/> power. <ref type="biblio">47</ref> These findings mirror those by academics. For instance, Bowling and<lb/> Phillips, writing in 2007, found that the use of the powers against black people is<lb/> disproportionate and that this is an indication of unlawful racial discrimination. <ref type="biblio">48</ref> The<lb/> second aspect of a rights-based approach to teaching police about their powers is to<lb/> think about the potential adverse impacts on the enjoyment of human rights. Most<lb/> cases, presumably given the high-profile nature of stop and search powers, involve<lb/> some discussion around equality and non-discrimination. The act of stopping and<lb/> searching can also undermine such rights as privacy and the right to be free from<lb/> detention, which is less frequent but nevertheless consistent responses from police<lb/> recruits. The purpose of integrating competing rights considerations into the<lb/> discussion-s that through stop and search, police can both protect and undermine<lb/> rights-is to provide a lens through which to better understand the legislation. That is,<lb/> in recognising both scenarios, it becomes clearer why the legislation exists as it does.<lb/></p>

			<p>For instance, returning to section 1 of PACE, there is an express requirement of<lb/> reasonable suspicion found in section 1(3). The test must be applied to the<lb/> circumstances in each case and is in two parts: (i) Firstly, the officer must have formed<lb/> a genuine suspicion in their own mind that they will find the object for which the<lb/> search power being exercised allows them to search and (ii) Secondly, the suspicion<lb/> that the object will be found must be reasonable. <ref type="biblio">49</ref> Reasonable grounds must be based<lb/> on objective facts. At this point, the question is posed as to why reasonable suspicion<lb/> must be held and what it might mean. Generally, reasonable suspicion must be<lb/> grounded upon objective facts and fall into two categories: Current Intelligence or<lb/> information, for example, the fact that a person matches the description of a suspect<lb/> in a nearby burglary and/or suspicious behaviour, for example, attempting to hide or<lb/> discard something, behaving nervously, or being seen with something that looks like<lb/> a controlled drug. Crucially, &apos;reasonable suspicion cannot be based on generalisations<lb/> or stereotypical images that certain groups or categories of people as more likely to be<lb/> involved in criminal activity.&apos; <ref type="biblio">50</ref> The requirement of reasonable suspicion informed by<lb/> objective facts can be thus understood against an initial framing of competing rights<lb/> interests; it preserves the power while limiting its application in ways that can be<lb/> discriminatory.<lb/></p>

			<p>49 Home Officer, PACE Code A, 2015<lb/> 50 Home Officer, PACE Code A, 2015, para. 2.2B(b)<lb/></p>

			<p>Another example exists in the respect of Section 2 PACE 1984. Under this provision<lb/> officers conducting a stop and search must also provide an individual with certain<lb/> information. For instance, an officer must first explain the grounds for the search. In<lb/> other words, why is the search being conducted? This requirement necessarily ties in<lb/> with the requirements of reasonable suspicion in that to explain why someone has<lb/> been stopped, there first must be a reasonable suspicion to explain. Secondly, an<lb/> officer must explain the object and purpose of the search. To this end, an officer must<lb/> also explain a third element-the legal power being used. These two elements must be<lb/> read together in the sense that the particular legal power being used impacts that<lb/> which can be searched for. In addition, an officer must tell an individual that they are<lb/> being searched alongside providing the identity of the officer, and the station to which<lb/> the officer is attached. If the officer is in plain clothes, they must produce a warrant<lb/> card and a person must be told that they are entitled to a copy of the search. These<lb/> requirements can again be understood against the initial framework of rights<lb/> contestation. The respective legislative provisions exist to balance the potential misuse<lb/> of these with the need to ensure that the police continue to possess the legal capacity<lb/> to conduct stop and searches.<lb/></p>

			<p>The above examples demonstrate elements that must be present before, during and<lb/> after conducting a stop and search. The utility of this approach is limited to one aspect<lb/> of the police curriculum, namely police powers. However, the ways in which police<lb/> hold and use these powers are important and rights contestation can be used to<lb/> interrogate a whole host of powers from powers of arrest to questioning, detention to<lb/> entry, search and seizure. Against the backdrop of the initial rights-based framing,<lb/> facilitated through open discussion about competing rights interests that can emerge,<lb/> recruits and officers are informed as to why legislation has been constructed in the<lb/> ways that it is. As a result, recruits are positioned to think critically about why specific<lb/> provisions are contained in the law; the objectives they seek to achieve; and what they<lb/> are attempting to prevent.<lb/></p>

			<head>Additional Benefits of a Rights-based Approach<lb/></head>

			<p>There are several benefits to a rights-based approach to teaching police powers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firstly, a human rights-based approach places human rights at the centre of police<lb/> education. As noted, not only are the police, as public bodies, legally obligated to<lb/> comply with human rights but this is also a stated aim of the College of Policing which,<lb/> to their credit, has afforded human rights a central place in the PEQF. However, the<lb/> complexity of the law can mean that precisely where human rights fit into these<lb/> obligations can be uncertain. Rather than viewing human rights as yet another layer<lb/> of information-one that sits alongside case law, primary and secondary legislation<lb/> and a suite of guidelines, codes, best practices and recommendations-under a human<lb/> rights-based approach to teaching they form the central element of police education.<lb/> This, inadvertently, helps police officers not only to know what their human rights<lb/> obligations are but to critically engage with competing rights. While looking at stop<lb/> and search, this could be applied in respect of a range of police powers (Bonner and<lb/> Dammert, 2021). <ref type="biblio">51</ref> Similarly, case law, when utilised correctly, can be used as an<lb/> additional teaching tool one that helps to elaborate on the real-life examples of<lb/> legislative provisions in action. As an example, section 2 of PACE is a provision that<lb/> tends to invoke much discussion amongst police recruits. For instance, while under s.<lb/></p>

			<p>2-the requirements to follow GOWISELY-appear in the PACE, 1984, case law has also<lb/> determined that the same information should be given when effecting a stop and<lb/> search under other pieces of legislation, such as the Misuse of Drugs Act. <ref type="biblio">52</ref> Thus, the<lb/> decisions of the courts help to identify that s.2 PACE must be followed when<lb/> conducting a stop and search under other pieces of legislation. Case law has also<lb/> helped to illuminate that when the police are confronted by a gang, it is not necessary<lb/> to reasonably suspect every member of the gang. <ref type="biblio">53</ref> Court rulings have also reaffirmed<lb/> that failing to follow the requirements laid down in s. 2 of PACE renders a stop and<lb/> search unlawful. <ref type="biblio">54<lb/></ref> Secondly, identifying the tensions inherent in rights not only assists in understanding<lb/> the law. It also acts as an organising concept for other sources. For instance, there will<lb/> always be additional questions on the technical aspects of law; what do we mean by<lb/> personal characteristics when it comes to the idea of reasonable suspicion? How do<lb/> abstract provisions relate to the many different scenarios that police officers are likely<lb/></p>

			<figure>51 Michelle D. Bonner and LucÃ­a Dammert &apos;Constructing police legitimacy during protests: frames and<lb/> consequences for human rights&apos; [2021], Policing and Society<lb/> 52 R v Fennelley [1989] CrimLR 142<lb/> 53 Howarth v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [2011] EWHC 2818 (QB)<lb/> 54 B v DPP [2008] EWHC 1655 (Admin); Osman v DPP (1999) Times 28/09/99<lb/></figure>

			<p>to face? On this latter point, experience drawn from teaching police recruits<lb/> illuminates that such questions are not only inevitable but also highly desirable and<lb/> useful. In contemplating potential scenarios and searching for answers to these<lb/> hypotheticals, recruits are fully engaging in the process of learning and seeking to<lb/> better interrogate how, faced with a particular set of circumstances, they might react.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is here, then, that additional sources of information, such as case law, and in the<lb/> context of PACE Stop and Search powers, PACE Code A, can exist not to add<lb/> additional layers of seemingly unconnected information but rather to elaborate on the<lb/> nature and scope of police powers. For instance, PACE Code A usefully elaborates on<lb/> the characteristics which cannot amount to reasonable suspicion. They include<lb/> someone&apos;s physical appearance (accept where is matches the description of a relevant<lb/> suspect), an individual&apos;s known past convictions, any protected characteristic (age,<lb/> disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy race, religion, sex and sexual orientation),<lb/> generalisations or stereotypes about groups of people. An officer&apos;s hunch or instinct<lb/> is not an objective factor on which to base a reasonable grounds search. <ref type="biblio">55<lb/></ref> Thirdly, a human rights-based approach to teaching pushes against the tendencies to<lb/> embrace the banking model of education. For instance, to assist with learning police<lb/> trainers often use a series of pnemonics to help officers remember the law. An example<lb/> is GO WISELY-used to help officers remember the information to be given upon<lb/> stopping and searching someone under certain pieces of legislation. COPPLAN-ID is<lb/> <ref type="biblio">55</ref> Home Officer, PACE Code A, 2015, para. 2.6B<lb/> another, utilised to assist officers in remembering the various grounds for necessity<lb/> under s. 24(5) of PACE when making an arrest. The mnemonic CIAPOAR helps users<lb/> to remember the six key elements of the NDM. It also acts as an aide-memoire in<lb/> aspects of decision-making. As a final example, DIE is used to remember the level of<lb/> search upon arrest. While these mnemonics serve as a useful device in helping officers<lb/> remember legislation, they can also serve to limit any level of critical thinking. For<lb/> example, while the G in GO WISELY is useful in helping to identify the grounds for<lb/> forming reasonable suspicion, they are limited in informing an officer what the basis<lb/> of that suspicion can be. However, understood against the backdrop of competing<lb/> rights, an officer is better equipped to form the basis of suspicion. Thus, a rights-based<lb/> approach can underpin these mnemonics and help ensure that officers are not simply<lb/> regurgitating acronyms in the absence of critical thinking.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The inspiration for this article came from delivering a number of courses as part of<lb/> changes to police recruitment and education. Underpinning these reforms is<lb/> undoubtedly a strong commitment to harnessing a police service that acts fairly,<lb/> lawfully and without discrimination. Indeed, professionalization and developing<lb/> analytical and informed officers is both necessary and desirable. However, achieving<lb/> these objectives is stifled by the complexity of the law, an overly ambitious<lb/> curriculum, and insufficient time afforded to cover the syllabus in sufficient detail.<lb/></p>

			<p>The result is that both teaching and learning are rooted in the banking model of<lb/> education where the aspirations of critical development are subverted to getting the<lb/> course done. It is thus necessary to think laterally regarding how best to work within<lb/> this system. As an alternative to the banking model of education, Freire articulated<lb/> what he termed the problem-solving method. Amongst other things, this method of<lb/> teaching emphasizes critical thinking for the purpose of liberation of the individual in<lb/> question. By shifting the delivery of information to a form of collaboration and<lb/> discussion, one where lived experiences and viewpoints of police recruits serve as<lb/> context for learning. A human rights approach to teaching seeks to harness the<lb/> inherent tensions and trade-offs associated with human rights to provide a lens<lb/> through which to look at specific legislative provisions. The intention of doing so is to<lb/> encourage recruits not simply to memorize the law, but to think analytically about<lb/> why the law is the way it is and what objective it seeks to achieve. Moreover, through<lb/> engaging recruits in discussion and debate about the rights that are employed, it is<lb/> recruits who are helping to construct the framework through which to examine and<lb/> understand the law as it will ultimately apply to them.</p>
