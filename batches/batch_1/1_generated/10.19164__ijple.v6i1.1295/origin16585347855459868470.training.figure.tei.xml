Furthermore, different pieces of legislation place different requirements<lb/> on the use of this power. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994,<lb/> for instance, contains a power which allows officers to search without reasonable<lb/> 21 Peter Leyland, (2021), The Constitution of the United Kingdom: A Contextual Analysis.

            <figDesc>police service are expected to uphold and the standards of behaviour they are<lb/> expected to meet. Many forces have their own values statements, which are<lb/> complementary to the Code of Ethics. Sometimes specific legislation requires the<lb/> government to publish guidance on a specific set of powers. For example, part IV of<lb/> the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires the government to publish and<lb/> maintain codes of practice on the powers in the Act (what are known as the PACE<lb/> Codes). Regarding Stop and Search Powers, for instance, the relevant Code of Practice<lb/> is Code A (Home Office, 2015). The College of Policing also publishes Authorised<lb/> Professional Practice (APP) documents. 26 These documents are themed around<lb/> different aspects of policing, advise police staff on how to use their powers lawfully<lb/> and effectively, and are designed to support the training and development of police<lb/> personnel. The police are expected to &apos;have regard&apos; to APP guidance whilst on duty.<lb/> In 2020, the College of Policing updated its Authorised Professional Practice for stop<lb/> 24 See Jessica Brown, &apos;Police powers: an introduction&apos; [17 June 2020], House of Commons Library Briefing<lb/> Paper, Number 8637.<lb/> 25 College of Policing.

            <figDesc>Curriculum (NPC). The NPC comprises learning standards which have been designed<lb/> to meet policing needs. Each of the learning standards is fully mapped to the<lb/> aforementioned Authorised Professional Practice, as well as to relevant National<lb/> Occupational Standards contained within the Policing Professional Framework. The<lb/> curriculum consists of approximately 23 thematic headings (see box 1).<lb/> Box 1: Themes Addressed in the National Police Curriculum<lb/> Understanding the Police Constable Role<lb/> Valuing Difference and Inclusion<lb/> Maintaining Professional Standards<lb/> Evidence-based Policing<lb/> Problem Solving<lb/> 27 College of Policing, Stop and search, Stop and search (college.police.uk)<lb/> Each of these specific themes has several learning outcomes. For instance, the learning<lb/> outcomes for managing conflict are as follows:<lb/> Box 2: Examples of PNC Learning Outcomes<lb/> 1. Examine the theories and models underpinning the causes of conflict within<lb/> policing interventions<lb/> 2. Explain the types of situations where conflict may occur and the appropriate<lb/> response<lb/> 3. Analyse the ethical and moral implications of the police using force<lb/> 4. Identify levels of tension within a conflict situation<lb/> 5. Describe the process for determining whether the use of force is necessary in a<lb/> conflict situation<lb/> 6. Examine alternatives to using force when involved in a conflict situation<lb/> 7. Employ personal protection skills within a conflict situation<lb/> 8. Effectively use personal protection equipment, physical and mechanical<lb/> restraints<lb/> 9. Effectively use personal safety skills as determined by the specific role of the<lb/> officer or designated operating environment<lb/> 10. Account for, and justify the use of force in a conflict situation<lb/> Each learning outcome then disaggregates further to encompass a range of what is<lb/> known as minimum core content-the bare minimum that each learning outcome must<lb/> achieve. These are specific aspects that must be addressed. If we-Effectively use<lb/> personal protection equipment, physical and mechanical restraints-the MCC are as<lb/> follows:<lb/> Box 3: Example of PNC Minimum Core Content<lb/> 1. Use of an authorised issue baton<lb/> 2. Use of an authorised incapacitant spray, including the effects of such usage and<lb/> aftercare requirements<lb/> 3. Application of physical and mechanical restraints<lb/> 4. Multi-officer techniques<lb/> 5. Possible medical implications following use of restraints and personal safety<lb/> equipment<lb/> 6. How to evaluate the use of personal protection equipment<lb/> Thus, notwithstanding the aspirations of the PEQF to develop and harness critical<lb/> thinking police officers, the NPC is, to put it mildly, &apos;very prescriptive about what</figDesc>
