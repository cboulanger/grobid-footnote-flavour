	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">As part of their training in England and Wales, police recruits are required to engage with a<lb/> complex mix of law, often with no prior background in legal education. In addition, they must<lb/> learn, understand, and apply the content of a highly descriptive national police curriculum<lb/> (NPC). The combination of these tasks, amongst other things, can limit the extent to which<lb/> police training can cultivate critical thinking, a central objective of efforts to professionalise the<lb/> police in recent times. In this article and based on the author&apos;s experience of teaching law to<lb/> police recruits, the challenges of the current approach to police training are explored through<lb/> Freire&apos;s pedagogy of the oppressed and what he terms the banking model of education. After<lb/> drawing connections between this model and the current approach to police training, a human<lb/> rights-based approach to police teaching is offered as an example of Freire&apos;s preferred problem-<lb/>solving method. Central to this model is utilising the views of recruits regarding the role of the<lb/> police in balancing rights to help understand the law as it exists.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">The training and education of police recruits in England and Wales was historically<lb/> &apos;provided through a patchwork of local provision, known as the Initial Police<lb/> Learning and Development Programme.&apos; 3 In 2011, the Home Secretary commissioned<lb/> Peter Neyroud, then Chief Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency,<lb/> to undertake a review of police leadership and training. During a subsequent Home<lb/> Affairs committee review, Neyroud stated the &apos;â€¦police service needs to move from<lb/> being a service that acts professionally to becoming a professional service.&apos; 4 Based on<lb/> his review, he outlined the principles of policing in the 21st Century as ensuring the<lb/> police are democratically accountable, legitimate, evidence-based, nationally (and<lb/> internationally) coherent, capable, competent, and cost-effective. 5 In 2016 and in<lb/> response, the UK College of Policing (CoP)-the professional body that oversees the<lb/> police in England and Wales-published the Police Education Qualification<lb/> Framework (PEQF), which provides a framework for degree-level entry qualifications<lb/> and sets out three entry routes for new probationer constables: 6<lb/></div>
