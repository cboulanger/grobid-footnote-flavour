Civics Test. 97 South Carolina requires students to take a test with questions from the 

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Civics Test, however, students are 

not required to pass the test. 98 Utah requires students to pass a "basic civics test" to 

receive a high school diploma. 99 

Civics Education and "The Founding Principles" -North Carolina and Other States 

North Carolina General Statutes 115C-81.45 addresses civics education. 100 In 2011, the 

North Carolina General Assembly adopted a version of the "Founding Principles Act," 101 

a model statute developed by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). 102 

ALEC describes itself as "America's largest nonpartisan, voluntary membership 

organization of state legislators dedicated to the principles of limited government, free 

markets and federalism." 103 North Carolina's Founding Principles Act took effect with 

the 2014-2015 school year. 104 The language of the statute may appear neutral, however, 

the Center for Media and Democracy, a self-described "nationally recognized

Federalist Papers." 109 It appears that ALEC has replaced the "Founding Principles Act" 

with the "Civic Literacy Act." 

Other states mention the "founding principles" in their statutes as well. Georgia, 110 

Louisiana, 111 North Carolina, 112 and South Carolina 113 have statutes which mention the 

"founding philosophy" or "founding principles" of the United States and address 

"federalism" or the "Federalist Papers" in the context of K-12 education. Georgia's statute 

mentions "limited government" 114 and the Utah Code Annotated mentions "founding 

principles" however, it does not include language regarding federalism and limited 

government. 115 Texas has a founding principles act pending before its legislature. 116 If 

passed, the bill would require "an elective course on the founding principles of the United 

States" in high school curricula. 117 

Civics Education Programs Outside the K-12 Classroom
