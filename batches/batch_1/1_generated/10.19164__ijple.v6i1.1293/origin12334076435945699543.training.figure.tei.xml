            <figDesc>have had opportunities to reflect on the law-related education program that I designed<lb/> and implemented for high schoolers. The first opportunity came in 2015 when I spoke at<lb/> the North Carolina School Library Media Association (NCSLMA) 2015 Conference and<lb/> discussed the Program&apos;s content. 18 In spring 2016, I reflected on the Program when I<lb/> created a version of the program for middle school students. Another opportunity to<lb/> reflect came when I wrote Five Key Points for Developing an Informative &quot;Know Your Rights&quot;<lb/> Seminar which was published in the fall 2016 issue of the American Bar Association<lb/> Young Lawyers Division Public Education Committee Newsletter. 19</figDesc>

            <figDesc>and is the work of former and current law students of Georgetown University Law Center<lb/> as well as attorneys. It covers practical topics in the field of law such as consumer law,<lb/> housing law, and criminal law. The book has an outline format and hypothetical<lb/> problems for class discussion. While I was lesson planning, the book served as a reminder<lb/> that even from the early days of law-related education programs, law-related education<lb/> was meant to be practical and applied to everyday life. Breaking Rank by Norm Stamper 21<lb/> and The Privilege of Silence by Steven M. Salky 22 provided useful information such as what<lb/> happens when average citizens encounter the police and the origin of the Miranda<lb/> Warnings as I was planning the Right to Remain Silent activity 23 in 2015. Wanda Cassidy<lb/> and Ruth Yates&apos; book Once Upon a Crime 24 was notable because it supports the notion that<lb/> even younger youth can be introduced to concepts of rights and responsibilities. In Once<lb/> Upon a Crime, Cassidy and Yates provide guidelines and plans for implementing mock<lb/> trials in Kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms.<lb/> Grant Johnson and Robert Hunter&apos;s report entitled Law-Related Education as a Delinquency<lb/> Prevention Strategy: A Three-Year Evaluation of the Impact of LRE on Students prompted me<lb/> to think about the impact of law-related education on students beyond the classroom.</figDesc>
