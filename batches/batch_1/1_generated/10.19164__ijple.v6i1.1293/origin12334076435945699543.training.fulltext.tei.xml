			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Law-related education is &quot;education to equip nonlawyers with knowledge and skills<lb/> pertaining to the law, the legal process and the legal system, and the fundamental<lb/> principles and values on which these are based.&quot; 2 Law-related education is a branch of<lb/> civics education although there is overlap between law-related topics and civics topics<lb/> because both areas include the study of the Bill of Rights, the study of the function of<lb/> government institutions, and the study of one&apos;s rights with respect to voting, jury duty,<lb/> etc. Often, the terms law-related education and civics education are used<lb/> interchangeably. However, there is a trend for law-related education to be associated<lb/> with violence prevention. In this article, I provide an overview of the origin of law-related<lb/> education, a discussion of a law-related education program that I developed for K-12 3<lb/> students, my reflections on implementing the program, key resources that I found during<lb/> my planning, an overview of state laws that address K-12 law-related and civics<lb/> education requirements, an analysis of North Carolina&apos;s civics education requirement,<lb/> and an overview of civics education programs outside the K-12 classroom.<lb/></p>

			<head>Origin of Law-Related Education<lb/></head>

			<p>The late Isidore Starr, social studies teacher and lawyer, is the father of law-related<lb/> education in the United States. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> In the 1950s and 1960s, he prepared case studies of<lb/> current U.S. Supreme Court cases for use in the classroom. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> While Starr is one of the more<lb/> well-known people in the field of law-related education, with an American Bar<lb/> Association award being named in his honor, <ref type="biblio">6</ref> there are others who were instrumental in<lb/> the beginnings of law-related education in the United States. Through the work of Minna<lb/> Post Peyser, the National Assembly on Teaching the Principles of the Bill of Rights<lb/> became affiliated with Columbia University and Teachers College. <ref type="biblio">7<lb/></ref> The 1970s were a particularly innovative time for law-related education. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> In 1972, law<lb/> students founded the Street Law program to teach high school students practical legal<lb/> principles at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> In 1975, West<lb/> 4 Feinstein, S., &amp; Wood, R. <ref type="biblio">(1995)</ref>.

(2018). Street Law, Inc.: context, history and future. International Journal of Public Legal<lb/> Education, 2(1), https://perma.cc/P8RH-2E4D<lb/> Practical Life Lessons 15 at a high school in Durham, North Carolina. My service-learning<lb/> project included teaching ninth and twelfth graders their rights and responsibilities and<lb/> allowing time for questions and discussion. Knowing that not all students would speak<lb/> up during the class discussion, I used exit tickets (end-of-class surveys in which students<lb/> may write responses to questions I have asked them or write down questions to ask me)<lb/> to see how the students were apprehending the information presented. For the session<lb/> entitled &quot;How to Be Safe on Social Media,&quot; I discussed a student who had many Facebook<lb/> friends. The student told her Facebook friends about her father&apos;s confidential settlement<lb/> with his employer. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> At the end of the lesson, students wrote responses on exit tickets<lb/> such as &quot;Everything you post is linked to some form of personal information,&quot; and &quot;I will<lb/> change my Facebook privacy settings.&quot; For the lesson, &quot;Never Leave Your Luggage<lb/> Alone at the Airport,&quot; I discussed Indonesia&apos;s death penalty for smuggling drugs, the<lb/> Indonesian government&apos;s sentencing to death of people caught drug smuggling, 17 and<lb/> how one should be vigilant regarding one&apos;s luggage at the airport. One student wrote in<lb/> an exit ticket, &quot;I learned how to be more cautious with my luggage.&quot; The students were<lb/> interested in the topics presented and they were learning about their rights and<lb/> responsibilities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reflections<lb/></head>

			<figure>I have had opportunities to reflect on the law-related education program that I designed<lb/> and implemented for high schoolers. The first opportunity came in 2015 when I spoke at<lb/> the North Carolina School Library Media Association (NCSLMA) 2015 Conference and<lb/> discussed the Program&apos;s content. 18 In spring 2016, I reflected on the Program when I<lb/> created a version of the program for middle school students. Another opportunity to<lb/> reflect came when I wrote Five Key Points for Developing an Informative &quot;Know Your Rights&quot;<lb/> Seminar which was published in the fall 2016 issue of the American Bar Association<lb/> Young Lawyers Division Public Education Committee Newsletter. 19<lb/></figure>

			<p>These opportunities to reflect have led me to the following conclusions about law-related<lb/> education programs:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. Providing attendees with information they can review later, even if the<lb/> information is only a link to a website is key. In 2015, I provided the link to my<lb/> slides for Practical Life Lessons to the students.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">18</ref></p>

			<p>2. Providing content that fits the format of the program and the interests of the<lb/> attendees is important. I have led law-related education programs in 20-minute<lb/> and one-hour timeframes. The time-allotted affects the breadth and depth of what<lb/> I am able to cover. In 20 minutes, I am able to introduce a topic and save the<lb/> remaining ten minutes for discussion. In one hour, I am able to provide more<lb/> details about the topic and lead a lengthier group discussion. The topics I selected<lb/> for the initial iteration were based on students&apos; interests and experience. I selected<lb/> &quot;How to be Safe on Social Media&quot; because many students have social media<lb/> accounts. I selected &quot;Never Leave Your Luggage Alone at the Airport&quot; because the<lb/> students attending the program were at a high school that sponsored travel<lb/> programs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Key Resources<lb/></head>

			<p>In preparing for the law-related education programs that I implemented in spring 2015<lb/> and 2016, I came across many resources, however six stand out:<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">• The original Street Law textbook entitled Street Law: A Course in Practical<lb/> Law,<lb/> • Breaking Rank by Norm Stamper,<lb/> • The Privilege of Silence by Steven M. Salky,<lb/> • Once Upon a Crime by Wanda Cassidy and Ruth Yates,<lb/> • Law-Related Education as a Delinquency Prevention Strategy: A Three-Year<lb/> Evaluation of the Impact of LRE on Students, by Grant Johnson and Robert<lb/> Hunter, and<lb/> • The Law-Related Education Act of 1978.<lb/> The original Street Law textbook was published by West Publishing Company in 1975 20<lb/></figure>

			<figure>and is the work of former and current law students of Georgetown University Law Center<lb/> as well as attorneys. It covers practical topics in the field of law such as consumer law,<lb/> housing law, and criminal law. The book has an outline format and hypothetical<lb/> problems for class discussion. While I was lesson planning, the book served as a reminder<lb/> that even from the early days of law-related education programs, law-related education<lb/> was meant to be practical and applied to everyday life. Breaking Rank by Norm Stamper 21<lb/> and The Privilege of Silence by Steven M. Salky 22 provided useful information such as what<lb/> happens when average citizens encounter the police and the origin of the Miranda<lb/> Warnings as I was planning the Right to Remain Silent activity 23 in 2015. Wanda Cassidy<lb/> and Ruth Yates&apos; book Once Upon a Crime 24 was notable because it supports the notion that<lb/> even younger youth can be introduced to concepts of rights and responsibilities. In Once<lb/> Upon a Crime, Cassidy and Yates provide guidelines and plans for implementing mock<lb/> trials in Kindergarten through fifth grade classrooms.<lb/> Grant Johnson and Robert Hunter&apos;s report entitled Law-Related Education as a Delinquency<lb/> Prevention Strategy: A Three-Year Evaluation of the Impact of LRE on Students prompted me<lb/> to think about the impact of law-related education on students beyond the classroom.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The report is particularly useful for its enumeration and explanation of features necessary<lb/> for an effective law-related education program. These recommendations include &quot;that<lb/> the system be depicted neither as infallible nor as a nightmare.&quot; <ref type="biblio">25</ref> The discussion of<lb/> negative realities of the legal system and how people can work within the legal system to<lb/> advocate for their rights needs to be balanced. From the beginning, law-related education<lb/> programs have embraced controversial topics, 26 however, law-related education was not<lb/> intended to be a depressing session where people share grievances or engage in never-<lb/>ending arguments. In the law-related education program that I led in 2015, I spoke of<lb/> practices students could implement in their daily lives such as not putting one&apos;s or one&apos;s<lb/> parents&apos; daily schedule information on social media (and why).<lb/></p>

			<p>The Law-Related Education Act of 1978 was part of a larger Education Amendments Act,<lb/> however, sections 346, 347, and 348 dealt specifically with law-related education. In<lb/> Section 346, Congress stated that it had found that there was a &quot;widespread lack of<lb/> understanding of how our system of law and legal institutions work.&quot; Furthermore,<lb/> &quot;such an understanding is essential&quot; for youth to become knowledgeable and responsible<lb/> citizens and &quot;there is an urgent need for Federal involvement&quot; to develop law-related<lb/> education programs. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> Section 347 included the definition of law-related education that I<lb/> stated above and empowered a Commissioner to carry out a program of grants so that<lb/> local actors could implement law-related education programs at the local level. These<lb/> programs would be for youth and adults, in community organizations, as well as schools<lb/> and universities. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> Section 348 authorized $15 million to implement the provisions of the<lb/> Act. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Accounting for inflation, the amount would be approximately $62 million in 2021. <ref type="biblio">30<lb/></ref> The law was repealed in 1982. <ref type="biblio">31<lb/></ref></p>

 State Laws that Address K-12 Law-Related Education Focus on Violence Prevention<lb/></head>

			<p>State statutes that address law-related education programs in the K-12 context focus on<lb/> violence prevention as the goal and not necessarily the goal of educating students to learn<lb/> the day-to-day rights and responsibilities of citizens. In Alabama, law-related education<lb/> is &quot;[e]ducation which provides children and youth with the knowledge and skills<lb/> pertaining to the law, the legal process, school safety, and citizenship responsibilities to<lb/> promote law-abiding behavior with the purpose to prevent children and youth from<lb/> engaging in delinquency or violence and enable them to become productive citizens.&quot; <ref type="biblio">32<lb/></ref> In Arizona, schools may apply for funding to offset the costs of placing school resource<lb/> officers, juvenile probation officers, school counselors and school social workers at the<lb/> school. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Schools that apply for the school safety program must have &quot;[a] plan for<lb/> implementing a law-related education program or a plan that demonstrates the existence<lb/> of a law-related education program as a school safety prevention strategy.&quot; <ref type="biblio">34</ref> In addition,<lb/> the governing board of schools may &quot;[e] nter into an intergovernmental agreement with<lb/> a presiding judge of the juvenile court to implement a law-related education program as<lb/> defined in section 15-154.&quot; <ref type="biblio">35</ref> The Colorado Revised Statutes mention &quot;rights and<lb/> responsibilities of citizenship&quot; as a topic within law-related education programs, 36<lb/> however, these law-related education programs are not mandated but &quot;strongly<lb/> encourage[d]&quot; 37 and their goal is to promote &quot;behavior which will reduce through<lb/> education the incidence of gang or other antisocial behavior and substance abuse by<lb/> students in the public school system.&quot; <ref type="biblio">38</ref> In addition, entities such as schools that seek<lb/> funding for comprehensive health education programs must &quot;include provisions for the<lb/> implementation of a law-related education program for the purpose of reducing the<lb/> incidence of gang involvement and substance abuse by students through education&quot; in<lb/> their applications. <ref type="biblio">39</ref> Iowa requires its department of education to &quot;develop a statewide<lb/> violence prevention program based on law-related education.&quot; <ref type="biblio">40</ref></p>

 Effective July 1, 2022,<lb/> New Mexico will require school resource officers to receive training in &quot;a variety of<lb/> instructional techniques as well as classroom management tools to provide law-related<lb/> education to students.&quot; 41 In Ohio, a certified training program for school resource officers<lb/> must include &quot;Providing assistance on topics such as classroom management tools to<lb/> provide law-related education to students and methods for managing the behaviors<lb/> sometimes associated with educating children with special needs.&quot; 42 New Jersey requires<lb/> 36 COLO.

			<p>officers and public school employees who are liaisons to law enforcement. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> In the<lb/> legislative findings for the law, the New Jersey Session laws note that &quot;most safe schools<lb/> resource officers perform many roles, including law enforcement officer, law-related<lb/> counselor and law-related education teacher.&quot; <ref type="biblio">44</ref> Throughout the aforementioned statutes,<lb/> law-related education is associated with preventing violence in school and the work of<lb/> school resource officers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Colorado, <ref type="biblio">45</ref> Washington, <ref type="biblio">46</ref> and Wyoming 47 permit participation in a law-related education<lb/> program as a sentencing option for youth in youth courts. Associating law-related<lb/> education only with policing and violence-prevention is problematic when there is<lb/> controversy over whether police should work in schools at all. Schools in Columbus, Ohio<lb/> removed school resource officers in response to student protests against a police presence<lb/> in the schools. <ref type="biblio">48</ref> Schools in Madison, Wisconsin removed school resource officers to adopt<lb/> a restorative justice approach and schools in Oakland, California removed school<lb/> resource officers to fulfill a request from the community. <ref type="biblio">49<lb/></ref> The origin of law-related education includes instruction on rights, responsibilities,<lb/> government institutions, and current court cases of interest as topics to be taught during<lb/> civics lessons in the classroom, therefore, mentions of law-related education in state law<lb/> should not be confined to the context of violence-prevention and sentences in youth<lb/> court. Those involved with law-related education programs should advise state<lb/> legislatures that law-related education is part of civics education and not primarily a<lb/> sentencing option in youth court or a subject for police officers who work in schools.<lb/></p>

			<head>Legislation that Addresses Civics Education in the K-12 Context Throughout the<lb/> United States<lb/></head>

			<p>Law-related education is a branch of civics and as such may be taught in schools even<lb/> though the terminology &quot;law-related education&quot; is not used. States that do not mention<lb/> civics education in their laws as well as states that do mention civics education in their<lb/> laws may require civics education through curricula approved by their departments of<lb/> education and therefore, civics may still be taught in their schools. <ref type="biblio">50</ref> My research has<lb/> <ref type="biblio">49</ref> Id.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">50</ref> The report Strengthening Democracy with a Modern Civics Education focuses on civics education<lb/> requirements set by local departments of education and lists all civics education requirements from local<lb/> departments of education for K-12 curricula for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Jeffrey, A. &amp;<lb/> Sargrad, S. (2019). Strengthening Democracy With a Modern Civics Education. Center for American Progress.<lb/> https://perma.cc/Z7VT-P9FW<lb/> yielded 28 states that address K-12 civics education in their statutes. Alabama requires<lb/> students to pass a course in government which includes a civics test. <ref type="biblio">51</ref> Arizona provides<lb/> for the recognition of K-12 students who excel in civics through a state seal of civics<lb/> literacy program. <ref type="biblio">52</ref> Arkansas&apos; requirements for social studies courses include civics. <ref type="biblio">53<lb/></ref> Colorado requires the teaching of history and civil government in schools and requires<lb/> that the civics portion of social studies complies with the subjects outlined in the law. <ref type="biblio">54<lb/></ref> In Connecticut, Students are required to take a half-credit course on civics and American<lb/> government to receive a high school diploma and the civics education requirement<lb/> continues for classes graduating in 2023 and later. <ref type="biblio">55</ref> In Florida, of the three social studies<lb/> credits required to receive a high school diploma, a half-credit must be in government. <ref type="biblio">56<lb/></ref> Idaho requires civics education or &quot;instruction in citizenship&quot; in all elementary and<lb/> secondary schools and secondary students must pass a civics test and take a course in<lb/> United States Government. <ref type="biblio">57</ref> Indiana requires that instruction in the Constitutions of<lb/> Indiana and the United States must be included as part of a civics course. <ref type="biblio">58</ref> Kansas<lb/> requires instruction in civil government and United States history as well as passing a<lb/> course in United States Government to graduate from high school. <ref type="biblio">59</ref> Louisiana requires<lb/> all public high schools to provide instruction in civics. <ref type="biblio">60</ref> Maine requires students to<lb/> receive instruction in civics to receive a high school diploma. <ref type="biblio">61</ref> Massachusetts requires all<lb/> public schools to teach civics. <ref type="biblio">62</ref> Michigan requires students to take a civics course to<lb/> receive a high school diploma. <ref type="biblio">63</ref> The civics course &quot;shall include the form and functions<lb/> of the federal, state, and local governments and shall stress the rights and responsibilities<lb/> of citizens.&quot; <ref type="biblio">64</ref> Minnesota has set academic standards and civics are part of these<lb/> standards. <ref type="biblio">65</ref> Missouri requires students to take courses on the constitutions of the United<lb/> States and Missouri, American history, institutions, and civics, and to pass a test on the<lb/> aforementioned subjects to receive a certificate of graduation. <ref type="biblio">66</ref> Montana aims for<lb/> students to &quot;develop a sense of personal and civic responsibility&quot; and for schools to<lb/> &quot;provide an in-depth understanding of the American political, social, and economic<lb/> systems and the historical context from which they arose&quot; as two of its goals for public<lb/> elementary and secondary schools. <ref type="biblio">67</ref> Nebraska requires each school board to form a<lb/> committee on American civics which must ensure that the social studies curriculum is<lb/> aligned with standards adopted by the State Board of Education and &quot;teaches<lb/> foundational knowledge in civics.&quot; <ref type="biblio">68</ref> New Hampshire requires students to take a half-<lb/>credit civics course to graduate from high school. <ref type="biblio">69</ref> New Mexico provides for civic<lb/> engagement experiences for its students.

There are, in fact, many scholarly differences of opinion<lb/> about what weight to accord writings of individuals involved in the drafting and ratification of the<lb/> Constitution. For example, a controversial Bush Administration attorney embraced what he called a<lb/> &quot;Hamiltonian&quot; view of virtually unlimited presidential power as a rationale for presidential violation of<lb/> laws barring torture and warrantless wiretapping. However, Hamilton&apos;s views of king-like presidential<lb/> power were not shared by other leading founding fathers or by the citizens in the states that ratified the<lb/> Constitution and who insisted upon the addition of an explicit Bill of Rights to guard against claims of<lb/> virtually unlimited governmental power to search and seize people and compel them to be witnesses<lb/> against themselves.&quot; The Center for Media and Democracy.

A Know<lb/> Your Rights Workshop for Teens sponsored by ACLU of Massachusetts and the Boston<lb/> Public Library 118 and the Teen Workshop (Ages 13-17): Know Your Rights sponsored by the<lb/> Glendale Human Coalition and Glendale Police Department of California 119 are<lb/> two examples of such programs.<lb/> The 2018 Cornell Law Institute for High School Students at Cornell Law School had a<lb/> civics or law-related education component through the discussion of the Fourth<lb/> Amendment to the United States Constitution. The 2018 Cornell Law Institute for High<lb/> School Students was an outreach program sponsored by the Cornell Law Library and did<lb/> not provide academic credit for the attendees. The overall goal of the Law Institute was<lb/> to introduce high school students to legal concepts and legal careers.<lb/></figure>

			<p>During the Law Institute, I led a write-around activity 120 regarding the Fourth<lb/> Amendment. Before the write-around activity, I discussed definitions of legal terms such<lb/> as warrant and probable cause and then gave the students a short news article to read<lb/> 118 Boston Public Library.

I directed them to write<lb/> their answers to the prompts on the same large paper (each group had its own large piece<lb/> of paper). I instructed the students not to speak to one another for the 15 minutes of<lb/> writing. Next, in their small groups, students discussed what they had written. After the<lb/> small-group discussions, I facilitated a large group discussion based on what the students<lb/> had written. The writing prompts consisted of the following questions:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. What do you know about probable cause so far?,<lb/> 2. What does the article about car searches based on marijuana smoke remind you of<lb/> in things you have seen on social media or TV?, and<lb/> 3. What do you think will happen next? Do you think the U.S. Supreme Court will<lb/> resolve the circuit split?

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>From the inception of law-related education, organizers of law-related education<lb/> programs have endeavored to make the programs practical by covering topics that the<lb/> students would need to know in daily life. Although the federal Law-Related Education<lb/> Act was repealed in 1982, states continue to address K-12 civics education in their<lb/> statutes. Recently, state legislatures that have used the term &quot;law-related education&quot; in<lb/> the K-12 context have focused on law-related education for violence prevention and<lb/> within the context of youth courts. Law-related education is about knowing one&apos;s rights<lb/> and responsibilities as a citizen even in situations where one has not been accused of<lb/> breaking the law and there needs to be a concerted effort to bring the essence of law-<lb/>related education within the purview of state legislatures. Additional programs aimed<lb/> toward teenagers that are organized outside the K-12 school context such as &quot;Know Your<lb/> Rights Workshops&quot; and other programs, for example the Cornell Law Institute for High<lb/> School Students, are also valuable in educating youth regarding civics and law-related<lb/> education. Law-related education is more than violence prevention. It is a branch of civics<lb/> that is a necessary part of K-12 education.</p>
