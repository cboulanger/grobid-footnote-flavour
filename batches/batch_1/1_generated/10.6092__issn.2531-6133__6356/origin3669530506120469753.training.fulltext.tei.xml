			<p>In the second decade of the new millennium, as we deal with the post-<lb/>financial market meltdown and the failure of self-correcting market theory<lb/> to prevent a global financial crisis, the legal pragmatists among us realize a<lb/> need to think carefully about the relationship between law, markets and<lb/> marketization. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Putting the recent financial collapse into perspective, we<lb/> should note that we have already spent some forty years with law and<lb/> economics as an important influence in jurisprudence, 2 bringing market<lb/> thinking firmly into law, and that we have already been through the<lb/> processes of globalization, harmonization, and the transition to market<lb/> economies in such countries as China, and in some of the countries of<lb/> Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Therefore, it is a fitting time to<lb/> reflect on the role of law in facilitating the ongoing process currently<lb/> referred to as marketization.<lb/></p>

			<p>The process of marketization can be understood in at least two<lb/> different ways. First, it might simply refer to the process of expanding<lb/> competition and choice. This interpretation is consistent with the<lb/> jurisprudence of people such as Adam Smith. A second way of understanding<lb/> marketization is in terms of legal commodification. This article uses the<lb/> second interpretation. The process of marketization as a form of<lb/> commodification is one in which various social, legal, political, and cultural<lb/> â€  E.I.

He has published sixteen books and<lb/> over 30 articles on subjects including law and market economy, real estate, land use, and Adam<lb/> Smith. This paper is the product of participating as a member in a series of meetings with the<lb/> Working Group on Marketization sponsored by the University of Helsinki, Finland. The working<lb/> group was interdisciplinary and comprised of about two dozen people from several countries<lb/> working in economics, sociology, biology, linguistics, science, and law.<lb/></p>

Thus, lawyers move from discussions of &quot;natural law&quot; and of<lb/> the moral foundations of law, to conversations of &quot;cost and benefit&quot; analysis<lb/> and the economics of justice. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Similarly, legal institutions increase their<lb/> focus on matters of &quot;efficiency&quot;, and increasingly speak of &quot;justice&quot; in terms<lb/> of economic opportunities and outcomes. The process of marketization<lb/> involves a reinterpretation of legal and social relationships in terms of the<lb/> needs of commerce, and it increasingly makes reference to economic terms<lb/> such as efficiency and wealth maximization when evaluating such<lb/> relationships. While this process does not equate law to economics, it does<lb/> mean that the legal interpretive frame of reference changes and that more<lb/> and more decision making is based on price calculations and other economic<lb/> considerations. In the process of marketization law serves the purpose of<lb/> commercialization by protecting property, promoting production, and<lb/> facilitating consumption and trade. Freedom, equality, fairness, and progress<lb/> become understood in terms of law&apos;s relationship to market interests;<lb/> including the perceived interests of owners, creditors, investors,<lb/> entrepreneurs, consumers, and workers.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this brief essay, I approach the process of marketization as one of<lb/> understanding the market from a legal perspective rather than one of doing<lb/> an economic analysis of law; and, I outline the way in which law functions as<lb/> a form of infrastructure to facilitate trade and exchange. Because the law and<lb/> legal institutions function primarily as infrastructure for trade and exchange,<lb/> they are frequently underappreciated. To many people, trade seems to happen<lb/> by operation of an invisible hand; with law appearing primarily when a<lb/> transaction goes bad and the parties need to resolve a dispute. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> Dispute<lb/> resolution is, of course, an important function of law, but much of law deals<lb/> with making transactions stable, efficient, and predictable, even as between<lb/> parties who are unknown to each other.<lb/></p>

			<p>The starting point for identifying the connections among law, markets, and<lb/> marketization probably goes back to Adam Smith. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> In THE WEALTH OF <ref type="biblio">NATIONS, 6<lb/></ref> published in 1776, Adam Smith observed that legal and economic systems<lb/> developed together and reflected a community&apos;s&apos; economic stage of<lb/> development. Smith identified four stages of development and suggested that<lb/> the age of commerce; based on the specialization of labor, the protection of<lb/> property, the freedom of contract, and the development of good legislation,<lb/> produced more prosperity and greater freedom than observable in any one of<lb/> the earlier three stages of hunting, herding, and farming. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> Each stage also<lb/> involved a stronger emphasis on property, and on the need for more<lb/> advanced legal arrangements to deal with property. For Smith, the age of<lb/> commerce and the process of marketization facilitated social progress. This<lb/> was because Smith understood that advancing through these stages involved<lb/> expanding opportunities for competition and choice, and this in turn<lb/> facilitated a rising standard of living for everyone.<lb/> Today, political and economic elites in emerging and developing<lb/> countries see the prospects for a more prosperous future arising from<lb/> marketization and the transition to a market economy. In such a market<lb/> economy, relationships are structured in terms of costs and benefits and are<lb/> translated in to value neutral exchanges. Talk of morals and politics are<lb/> implicitly sidestepped as interaction is driven by the desire for making money<lb/> and for turning a profit. This may potentially reduce interpersonal conflict as<lb/> people are motivated by self-interest to work at making money and<lb/> improving their personal fortunes rather than engaging in conflict over<lb/> abstract ethical, moral, and theological matters. In Smithian terms, this may<lb/> also be beneficial because individuals pursuing their own self-interest<lb/></p>

			<p>naturally advance the public interest at the same time; even though the<lb/> public interest may be no part of their original intention. <ref type="biblio">8<lb/></ref> To be effective, the process of marketization requires embracing a<lb/> need to reform other institutions to reflect the language, values, and<lb/> outcomes that a market economy will hopefully bring. This is because market<lb/> economies not only need the infrastructure of open and unrestricted trade;<lb/> they need the validation of desirability from a variety of other social<lb/> institutions. Marketization, thus, becomes the process of cross validation of<lb/> institutional support for a more open, competitive, and decentralized<lb/> coordination of scarce goods, resources, and services; and, ultimately for<lb/> stronger legal rights. In the process, law not only provides the infrastructure<lb/> for more efficient market activity, it normalizes the power dynamics of<lb/> market relationships and makes them appear &quot;natural.&quot; <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> In exploring these ideas, this essay describes some of the key ways<lb/> that law and legal institutions facilitate market exchange. The essay is not<lb/> intended to be all encompassing nor overly detailed. It is meant to offer a<lb/> general and overarching understanding of the various ways in which law<lb/> usefully functions to incentivize and protect market expectations. In<lb/> proceeding, therefore, I should note that many of the ideas expressed herein<lb/> extend on work explored in two of my early books: Law and Market Economy:<lb/></p>

			<p>Reinterpreting the Values of Law and Economics; 10 and Law in a Market Context: An<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Introduction to Market Concepts in Legal Reasoning. 11</ref> In each of these books I<lb/> develop the idea of law and market economy. This approach is one based on<lb/> understanding the market as a dynamic process of exchange in which the act<lb/> of exchange itself creates and transforms meanings and values in the<lb/> relationships of participants and the things they trade. 12 For instance, when<lb/> the United States engages in trade with China, both countries have a change<lb/> in values over time. While the United States may believe that trade facilitates<lb/> China becoming more invested in freer markets and in democratic reforms,<lb/> the United States simultaneously experiences pressure to adjust its labor and<lb/> production practices in order to be more competitive with China.<lb/></p>

			<p>Consequently, as with any exchange relationship, both sides to the exchange<lb/> influence each other because exchange requires the continuous mediation of<lb/> conflicting cultural-interpretive tensions.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this approach, the problems of the law are economic because law<lb/> governs the ways that people deal with the competition for limited resources;<lb/></p>

			<p>and, the problems of economics are legal because law provides the &quot;tools&quot;<lb/> and infrastructure for trade and exchange. Consequently, this approach<lb/> focuses on the strategic role of law in relation to the stages of social<lb/> development; and, marketization involves the movement of a community<lb/> from the early stages of economic development (the age of hunters, herders,<lb/> and farmers), to the more advanced stages of commerce. In this transition to<lb/> a commercial society, it is also important to understand that the value of any<lb/> given market transaction depends on its position and its relation to all other<lb/> elements of a given system of exchange (a given market context). Thus,<lb/> exchange and the values generated by it are contextually informed by a<lb/> variety of factors such as history, ideology, and culture. In such an<lb/> environment, price functions as a relative interpretation of value; and is not<lb/> value itself. An important implication of this is that cost and benefit analysis<lb/> implicitly incorporates within its calculus a set of historical, ideological, and<lb/> cultural values. For this reason, cost and benefit analysis cannot provide a<lb/> neutral and objective approach to legal decision making. Cost and benefit<lb/> analysis must reflect community values with respect to relative pricing, and it<lb/> favors values that are easily priced over values that are abstract and difficult<lb/> to price, while privileging the preferences of those with many resources over<lb/> the preferences of those with few resources. In this context, law not only<lb/> facilitates these transactions, it normalizes them and makes them appear to<lb/> be natural and desirable.<lb/></p>

			<p>In exploring the ways that law functions as an infrastructure for<lb/> markets and marketization, I proceed in two steps. First, I consider the<lb/> relationship between law and markets; where trades are organized, stabilized,<lb/> and pursued in ways that respond to the legal environment in which trade<lb/> takes place. Second, I address the relationship between law and the process of<lb/> marketization; where marketization is understood as the process of<lb/> institutionalizing and incentivizing interpersonal relationships in terms that<lb/> facilitate the capture and creation of value through trade.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. LAW &amp; MARKETS<lb/></head>

			<p>Markets are about the human process of exchange; a giving of a &quot;this&quot; for a<lb/> &quot;that&quot;. In this process, the rules, standards, and norms of law mediate the<lb/> tension between private and public interest so as to peacefully promote the<lb/> common interest. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Importantly, law organizes exchange by creating the<lb/> infrastructure to expand beyond local and informal trade networks. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> It does<lb/> this in several ways. For the purposes of this paper, discussion is focused on<lb/> five key functions of law. These functions include establishing and<lb/> enhancing: 1) acceptable networks and patterns of exchange; 2)<lb/> transparency; 3) predictability; 4) stability; and 5) trust.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law is critical to formalizing exchange networks that operate<lb/> effectively across time, and beyond reliance on local and personal<lb/> relationships. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Law defines and frames the terms, consequences, and<lb/> acceptable objects of exchange. It also categorizes different types of<lb/> exchanges; such as by consent (contract), gift, and operation of law. Each of<lb/> these categories of exchange has different rules. Likewise, law informs us<lb/> about who may engage in certain types of exchanges. For example, minor<lb/> children (under the age of eighteen years) often have no power or only<lb/> limited power to engage in certain types of trades, and corporations have to<lb/> meet certain tests to qualify as legal persons able to enforce contracts or<lb/> conduct legal trades. In a similar way, law often regulates pricing and the<lb/> content of exchange agreements, while also limiting legally permissible<lb/> objects of exchange. For example, law permits trade in oil, diamonds, and<lb/> automobiles but does not generally permit transactions for the sale of babies,<lb/> body parts, or governmental elections.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law must also define consequences of trades. Some trades, if permitted and<lb/> properly executed, are upheld by law, other types of trades such as those in<lb/> violation of the appropriate exchange rules (exchanges on the black market,<lb/> for instance), may be disallowed and the parties may be charged with crimes.<lb/> Some exchanges may be legally classified as fraudulent or be unenforceable<lb/> because of the way in which one party obtained the consensual compliance of<lb/> the other party. The nature of what is exchanged, who participates in<lb/> exchange, and the terms and consequences of exchange are all structured in<lb/> reference to law and legal institutions. Even informal and illegal trades make<lb/> reference to formal law by the simple fact that they hold the status of<lb/> informal and illegal exchanges because they are outside of the formal<lb/> framework.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to identifying the permitted objects of exchange, law<lb/> functions to describe, quantify, and represent the objects of trade. For<lb/> example, the law may provide for private property ownership and for the sale<lb/> and purchase of property within certain approved exchange networks. For<lb/> this to work effectively, law must also describe and define the interest being<lb/> exchanged. Thus, law has to provide a representation of the property that can<lb/> be easily dealt with; this can be accomplished with a deed or other document<lb/> of title. The deed is not the property but a representation of the property that<lb/> is easier to deal with. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> Extending this example, the deed can be used to<lb/> represent a person&apos;s interest in a particular property and can be used to<lb/> support credit, as in using it to secure a mortgage. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> The mortgage is thus a<lb/> representation of a right against the property by the creditor in the event of<lb/> nonpayment, and simultaneously a representation of the right to receive a<lb/> stream of cash flow under the terms of the mortgage repayment schedule. As<lb/> a representation of the cash flow under the mortgage, this representation can<lb/> be used to support the issuing of a security based on the expected value of the<lb/> cash stream (e.g. mortgage backed securities). <ref type="biblio">18</ref> All of this facilitates trade<lb/> and enhances the opportunities for capturing and creating value from<lb/> exchange.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law plays an important role in establishing transparency in the exchange<lb/> network. Transparency is very important for purposes of reducing<lb/> transactions costs, particularly in large and impersonal trading networks. <ref type="biblio">19<lb/></ref> Transparency performs at least two very critical functions. It reduces<lb/> information and search costs across the network, and it facilitates the process<lb/> of authentication. The idea of information and search costs is well known.<lb/></p>

			<p>Authentication is probably less well understood. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Authentication is a key<lb/> factor in exchange. It involves the ability to &quot;prove out&quot; the substance of a<lb/> trade. This includes confirming the identity of the other parties, the validity<lb/> of the documents, the accuracy and availability of credit, and the substance of<lb/> the underlying object of the trade. For example, in a ponzi scheme (such as<lb/> that undertaken by Bernie Madoff) <ref type="biblio">21</ref> , and as in the recent collapse of<lb/> mortgage markets in the United States, there was little or no reality in the<lb/> underlying economic substance of the trade to support the represented value<lb/> of the exchange. In each case the underlying value was misrepresented such<lb/> that the exchange at the level of a representational interaction (e.g. buying<lb/> securities based on an underlying real estate transaction) was not an<lb/> authentic reflection of the actual economic substance of the underlying<lb/> situation. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> People were engaging in trades that had no sound basis in<lb/> economics because they either did not or could not properly authenticate the<lb/> underlying arrangements upon which their trades were based. Law can<lb/> provide mechanisms for making it possible to better authenticate the trades<lb/> people are making. Transparency thus reduces risk and lowers the cost of<lb/> exchange.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law facilitates predictability in exchange. This also reduces risk and<lb/> cost. By establishing uniform documents, and promoting the standardization<lb/> and harmonization of the terms and conditions of trade, law enhances<lb/> predictability while reducing bargaining costs. Law identifies the background<lb/> legal framework and default rules that apply to certain exchanges and it<lb/> establishes remedies for particular types of failures in performance among<lb/> 19 MALLOY, supra note 2; MALLOY, supra note 3.<lb/> 20 Malloy, supra note 1.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">21</ref> See STEPHANIE YANG, 5 Years Ago Bernie Madoff Was Sentenced to 150 Years In Prison -Here&apos;s How His<lb/> Scheme Worked, <ref type="biblio">BUSINESS INSIDER, (Jul. 1, 2014)</ref>, http://www.businessinsider.com/how-bernie-<lb/>madoffs-ponzi-scheme-worked-2014-7.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">22</ref> Malloy, supra note 1.<lb/> the parties. With shared knowledge of these criteria, strategic planning and<lb/> structuring of a trade is greatly enhanced because the parties have a more<lb/> predictable basis for assessing and managing risk.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law, through legal institutions, must also establish stability. Even<lb/> though markets are dynamic and fluid, the legal system must impose a sense<lb/> of stability on the networks of exchange. Just as it is difficult and costly to<lb/> work in an environment when one never knows if there will be electric power<lb/> available, or if the computer system will be working, or if the banks will be<lb/> open and operating from one day to the next, so too if the stability and<lb/> longevity of the legally supported network is in doubt. Markets can be<lb/> destabilized when governments simply confiscate private property, or<lb/> unexpectedly deflate the currency. Likewise, if the very governance structure<lb/> and functionality of a state and its legal system are in question, exchange will<lb/> be much more difficult and costly.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, we know from the success of some informal exchange<lb/> networks that trust is an important element of a strong, extensive, and<lb/> efficient trading network. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> Trust can arise within kinship groups, in local<lb/> communities where everyone knows each other, and in other specified<lb/> circumstances. Trust, however, is really about reputation value. Close friends<lb/> can trade with each other because they probably have good information about<lb/> each other and they have a sense of the reputational value of the likely<lb/> performance of the other party to the exchange (trust). Law can facilitate<lb/> trust by backing up and enhancing that which already exists in the network<lb/> of trades taking place. It can also make many more trades possible by<lb/> providing a substitute reputational reference point. A party can effectively<lb/> trade with another unfamiliar party over a very long distance and across a<lb/> long time horizon if both parties place a high value on the rule of law and<lb/> legal framework applicable to their exchange. In other words, a transparent,<lb/> predictable, stable, and well defined legal system can provide the reputational<lb/> trust value necessary to facilitate trade on a global scale.<lb/> Some aspects of a legal system may even become individually<lb/> &quot;branded&quot;. While there are a number of strong legal systems from which to<lb/> <ref type="biblio">23</ref> See FRANCIS FUKUYAMA, TRUST: THE SOCIAL VIRTUES AND THE CREATION OF <ref type="biblio">PROSPERITY (1996)</ref>.<lb/> choose when doing trades (choice of law rules), some aspects of a particular<lb/> system may take on the status of a highly sought after brand product. For<lb/> example, many exchanges involving admiralty and maritime law select<lb/> England and English law to govern the trades. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> Similarly, in the United<lb/> States, many people select the law of the state of Delaware in choosing to<lb/> incorporate their business. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> Maritime law and England, and corporate law<lb/> and Delaware; these are examples of particular legal institutions that have<lb/> gained &quot;brand status&quot; for facilitating trust among distant and impersonal<lb/> exchange partners trading in these particular legal categories.<lb/></p>

			<p>While particular details of law and legal institutions are subject to<lb/> many variables, it seems critical for law to perform the above five functions.<lb/></p>

			<p>In facilitating markets by providing a formal infrastructure of exchange, law<lb/> reduces the cost of trading and it makes it possible to extend the networks of<lb/> exchange beyond that of purely local and personal arrangements. This is<lb/> important because value and opportunity are greatly enhanced as the scale of<lb/> trading increases and the flow of information expands. Global market activity<lb/> and economic growth on a large scale are only really manageable under a rule<lb/> of law. Among other things this rule of law must address are: exchange,<lb/> transparency, predictability, stability, and trust.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. LAW &amp; MARKETIZATION<lb/></head>

			<p>By the term marketization I refer to the process of institutionalizing the<lb/> meanings and values of exchange in networks designed to transform,<lb/> capture, and create value from economically beneficial trades. This process<lb/> is facilitated by law in several ways. Law provides infrastructure for: 1) fixing<lb/> of assets (defining property / the process of assetization); 2) transferring of<lb/> assets (most significantly for markets the voluntary transfer by contract); 3)<lb/> authenticating and valuing assets; and 4) sustaining a dynamic process of<lb/> value formation.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 ASSETIZATION<lb/></head>

			<p>Assetization is the process of fixing assets so that they are capable of easy<lb/> exchange. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> This includes fixing a writing for purposes of copyright, and<lb/> fixing an invention for purposes of patent law, just as much as it includes<lb/> fixing a legal description and an estate interest for the identification of real<lb/> property. 27 Thus, while real property and intellectual property may have<lb/> significantly different qualities, each is able to be properly understood as a<lb/> property asset because each involves the fixing of an interest within the basic<lb/> framework of a property law regime. The idea that certain interests might<lb/> also be describable in non-property terms does little to diminish the reality<lb/> that such an interest can also be a legally fixed property asset. 28 Not all<lb/> property assets need to share exactly the same qualities or characteristics.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fixing an asset involves identification, definition, and assignment of<lb/> certain qualities, characteristics, and categories to it. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> The underlying<lb/> qualities include definitional matters such as fixing a legal description and<lb/> the particular estate interest for real property. In terms of assigning<lb/> characteristics to the asset, the typical characteristics of ownership include<lb/> the right of use and possession, the right to exclude, the right to transfer, and<lb/> the right to the profits attributed to the asset (including equity<lb/> appreciation). <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Finally, property related assets are categorized in such terms<lb/> as real, personal, intangible, cultural, and intellectual property. This permits<lb/> a more nuanced treatment of the asset. Fixing the asset also involves<lb/> ascribing certain default rules, such as remedies, for example, to transactions<lb/> in that asset. 31 Thus, by simply categorizing something as &quot;real property&quot; one<lb/> can ascribe certain qualities, characteristics, and potential causes of action to<lb/> the asset. This makes dealing with the asset more efficient by reducing<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">26 See, e.g., Robin Paul Malloy, Real Estate Transactions and Entrepreneurship: Transforming Value<lb/> Through Exchange, 43 IND. L. REV. 1150 (2010); DE SOTO, supra note 14.<lb/> 27 Malloy, supra note 26.<lb/> 28 Malloy, supra note 26.<lb/> 29 Malloy, supra note 26.<lb/> 30 See JOSEPH WILLIAM SINGER, PROPERTY LAW: RULES, POLICIES AND PRACTICES (4th ed. 2006).<lb/> 31 See RICHARD H. THALER AND CASS R. SUNSTEIN, NUDGE: IMPROVING DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH, WEALTH<lb/> AND HAPPINESS (2008).<lb/></figure>

			<p>various transaction costs associated with learning about its potential value.<lb/></p>

			<p>Property law and property lawyers focus primarily on the fixing of assets. <ref type="biblio">32<lb/></ref> Assetization is a more flexible term than property because the idea of<lb/> property has different meanings in different communities, and the legal<lb/> mechanisms for dealing with property vary significantly among and between<lb/> common law and civil law jurisdictions. There are some interests such as<lb/> trademark which function in many ways like property but are not categorized<lb/> as property. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> We can talk about &quot;property-like&quot; assets in a broader context<lb/> of discussing assets that express property-like characteristics in certain<lb/> circumstances and under certain conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Once fixed, assets become commodified and they are capable of being<lb/> more readily traded and exchanged in the marketplace.Part of assetization,<lb/> therefore, involves the creation of standard and formal representations of the<lb/> assets; such as developing paper representations of assets that are difficult to<lb/> move or are abstract in nature; including deeds for real property that<lb/> &quot;represent&quot; the interest held in an underlying piece of land, and mortgage<lb/> documents that represent the right to cash flow from payments being made<lb/> to purchase land on a credit basis (as well as contingent rights to the land<lb/> itself if the borrower defaults), and a patent or copyright representing rights<lb/> in a given invention or expression.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 TRANSFERRING ASSETS<lb/></head>

			<p>There are generally three methods of transferring property: by gift, operation<lb/> of law, and by exchange for value. A gift is generally not a market event in<lb/> the sense that it need not involve a quid pro quo exchange. A transfer by<lb/> operation of law involves such things as a transfer of ownership under the<lb/> rules applicable at death; the law by its operation transfers the asset from<lb/> one party to another. Exchanges for value can be consensual or forced.<lb/></p>

			<p>Consensual exchanges make up the biggest part of market transactions<lb/> between willing buyers and sellers. Forced exchanges might include transfers<lb/> by trespass with a remedy, or a takings with just compensation under the<lb/> United States Constitution, or a taking under the property provisions of<lb/> constitutional documents as they exist in many countries. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> Law must<lb/> provide rules, standards, and institutional infrastructure for each type of<lb/> transfer, with consensual transfers being of most interest to the idea of<lb/> market exchange. Thus, there are rules on contract formation, performance,<lb/> and enforcement, as well as rules dealing with gifts and other types of<lb/> transfers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two important concepts that facilitate incentivizing transfers are<lb/> liquidity and leverage. In turn, both of these are enhanced by the fact that<lb/> assets can be fixed and represented in documentary form. Liquidity involves<lb/> the velocity of value capture, formation, and transformation through market<lb/> exchange. <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Assetization involves the fixing of assets, and liquidity relates to<lb/> the efficiency of the exchange networks. Liquidity is enhanced by a system of<lb/> uniform and predictable contract rules, standardization of forms and<lb/> documentation, certainty of pricing, ease of spreading risk, and availability of<lb/> good information. Liquidity is also enhanced by expanding the scale of the<lb/> market to include more and more potential traders.<lb/> Related to liquidity is the idea of leverage. Leverage advances the<lb/> quantity and volume of trade value by allowing current access to future value<lb/> by way of debt and equity financing. <ref type="biblio">36</ref> Leverage can facilitate liquidity by<lb/> making more exchanges possible by expanding the amount of money/credit<lb/> in circulation. Liquidity focuses on the velocity of exchange and leverage<lb/> expands the pool of credit available for exchange.<lb/></p>

			<p>Connectivity is also important to transactions and trade. An expanding<lb/> market creates more and more opportunities for interactive exchange<lb/> combinations. <ref type="biblio">37</ref> As the exchange combinations expand, the system can<lb/> become more diverse and organize more and more information, thereby<lb/> enhancing the potential for value-adding creativity. Connectivity is akin to<lb/> <ref type="biblio">34</ref></p>

As with a computer or cell<lb/> phone network, expanding the legal infrastructure of exchange to enhance<lb/> liquidity, leverage, capacity, accessibility, and strategic interaction can<lb/> increase participation value for all users. The more interconnected (in the<lb/> sense of degrees of connectivity) the system and the larger the scaling of<lb/> exchange, the more strategic the network is to the value of market activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law facilitates connectivity by developing uniform documents,<lb/> standardizing and harmonizing rules and norms, and by establishing a set of<lb/> default rules that lower the cost of bargaining. Law also functions to expand<lb/> the market by creating a partial substitute and an enhancement to &quot;trust&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>Law can provide a formal, transparent, predictable, and stable substitute for<lb/> local and personal contacts. In this way, the trust functions of personal<lb/> knowledge and experience can be substantially shifted from the individuals to<lb/> the reputational value of the legal system governing exchange, and if the<lb/> system is highly regarded it can function to reduce the risk associated with<lb/> impersonal exchanges across place, space, and time. This reputational value<lb/> may be associated with strong protection of rights to assets, well developed<lb/> contract rights and remedies, objective (apolitical) decision making, and a<lb/> variety of other factors.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 AUTHENTICATION AND VALUATION OF ASSETS<lb/></head>

			<p>In order for the marketization process to work effectively law must provide<lb/> mechanisms to facilitate authentication and valuation. 38 Authenticating a<lb/> transaction is similar to the idea of authenticating a password access to<lb/> certain web pages on the internet, or authenticating a right to be in a given<lb/> place by use of encrypted codes driven by finger prints and other devices. In<lb/> the typical transactional setting it means authenticating the existence of the<lb/> asset, its basic quality and quantity, and such things as the authority of the<lb/> person transferring the goods. It also involves authenticating the<lb/> &quot;originality&quot; and completeness of all documentation. Some ways of dealing<lb/> with these issues require reference to information recorded on the public<lb/> records; review of corporate documents with respect to corporate existence<lb/> and authority of particular individuals to transfer assets; surveying with<lb/> respect to land, and other similar action such as credit checks. The basic idea<lb/> is that markets with good tools for authentication have more liquidity, better<lb/> capacity for leverage, and greatly reduced risk.<lb/></p>

			<p>As to valuation, law must provide a means for translating value into<lb/> easily measurable units, usually in terms of money for purposes of trade. In<lb/> the marketization process, price, to a large extent, serves as an interpretation<lb/> of value. Through pricing mechanisms, complex systems become easily<lb/> comprehensible in terms of the relative exchange values between different<lb/> positions in the system. Pricing performs the function of translating<lb/> numerous competing preferences and values into a common language. This<lb/> enhances the speed and ease of comparing relative tradeoffs across a large<lb/> scale network. Law and legal institutions need to define the acceptable and<lb/> enforceable methods of translating price into value and the degree to which<lb/> particular translations will be backed up with legal sanctions and remedies. <ref type="biblio">39<lb/></ref> More particularly, value is a complex theoretical subject but we can<lb/> begin to understand some basic elements of value by thinking in terms of<lb/> three transactional categories of value: use value, exchange value, and<lb/> network value. Simply and briefly stated: use value is the value derived from<lb/> being able to use an asset (a house provides shelter); exchange value is the<lb/> value, and potential value, that an asset represents as an access point to the<lb/> market (the ability to borrow against one&apos;s home, or its value in resale); and,<lb/> network value is the value of an asset in relationship to an integrated plan of<lb/> asset exchanges (such as the value of housing in terms of being a source of<lb/> employment for construction workers and lumber companies, and as an<lb/> engine for furniture and appliance sales, and in terms of an input item, via<lb/> mortgage activity, to securitized asset markets).<lb/></p>

			<p>Value must, of course, also account for different underlying measures<lb/> of fair market, hedonic, and contingent valuation across the above three<lb/> mentioned categories. It also requires knowledge of present discounted value<lb/> <ref type="biblio">39</ref> See EVE PREMINGER ET AL., TRUSTS AND ESTATES PRACTICE IN N.Y. Â§ 9:249 (Volume D-E New York<lb/> Practice Series)(explaining that the three most common methods used to determine the fair<lb/> market value of real property are cost method, income capitalization and the comparable sales<lb/> method); see also MALLOY, supra note 3 (discussing contingent and hedonic value); see also HAAS,<lb/> supra note 35, at 53-5 (explaining how to calculate discounted present value).<lb/> and the extent to which various legal rules account for different definitions of<lb/> value.<lb/></p>

			<p>The process of marketization can be positive when it expands the<lb/> opportunities for trade. For instance, being in a small village with an<lb/> informal market system provides much less value enhancing potential than<lb/> being connected to a larger scale national or global market network. In the<lb/> local market, people may know each other and have relatively good<lb/> information about the people and parties to an exchange. Larger and more<lb/> effective exchange networks bring in more and more people so that discrete<lb/> bits and pieces of knowledge (embedded within individual and personal<lb/> experiences) come into the market. It is the bringing together and mixing of<lb/> fragmented information that allows for opportunities to discover new, better,<lb/> and lower cost avenues of trade.<lb/></p>

			<p>Marketization can have negative implications to the extent that it<lb/> involves subordinating a variety of cultural and ethical values to a system in<lb/> which price stands not just for an interpretation of value but is interpreted as<lb/> value itself. Thus, rewriting the grounds upon which human relationships<lb/> take place. It can be a move away from the idea of the sacred, of nature, of<lb/> the spiritual, and the mystical, to the rational reduction of feelings and<lb/> emotion into a cost and benefit calculus; a calculus in which all human values<lb/> are expressed in terms of wealth calculations, whereby everything is given a<lb/> price, and wealth maximization becomes the highest value. Law must<lb/> function to &quot;soften&quot; the marketization process to ensure that it is understood<lb/> as a means to achieving desirable human ends, and that it avoids the<lb/> temptation to become a simplifying end in itself.<lb/></p>

			<p>To be positive, marketization has to be based on the advancement of<lb/> human values and the respect for community standards and norms.<lb/></p>

			<p>Marketization does not involve merely privileging the individual pursuit of<lb/> self-interest. Market actors are social beings embedded within a culture. In<lb/> order for the pursuit of self-interest to be positive it must be tempered with a<lb/> regard for others, and this tempering and constraint is judged with reference</p>
