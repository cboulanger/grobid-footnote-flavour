ABSTRACT: It is said that no book on the common law surpasses the importance of Sir 
William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. But it is also said that the 
Commentaries is of questionable merit, with aspects of it downright incoherent. The most 
fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this disparaging characterization is 
its discussion and use of what it usually calls "the law of nature" -and what we these 
days usually call "natural law." Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually 
many mistakes -of natural law? This article answers that it is not the Commentaries, but 
rather its critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from the 
expectation that Blackstone's natural law would take after Thomas Aquinas's (or even 
Christopher St. German's) natural law. But readers of the Commentaries who allow 
Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable treatment that animates 
the whole. Blackstone's natural law owes much to two influences, Roman law and the 
Anglican Church. The second influence is the more distinctive and guides Blackstone's 
response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural law as an order immanent in 
human law, an order especially prominent within the common law. Seen in this light, 
natural law provides the foundation for the Commentaries and a foundation for 
understanding law in our own day.

1. INTRODUCTION 

"[P]erhaps the most important single book . . . in the history of the 

common law" is Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of 

England (hereinafter Commentaries). 1 No other book but the Bible had a 

greater role in generating American institutions 2 and the nineteenth 

century alone saw about one hundred American versions. 3 It is said that 

the Commentaries led early American courts to decide from principles, not 

precedents. 4 But it is said also that the Commentaries is of questionable 

merit, 5 with aspects of it downright incoherent. 6 

The most fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this 

disparaging characterization is its discussion and use of what it usually 

calls "the law of nature." 7 "Natural law" is the term more frequently used 

these days for a transcendent legal order to which human law necessarily 

bears some relationship. Because Blackstone's concept of the "law of 

nature" is similar to that of contemporary "natural law," this article

of the Founding: "Even those who rejected Blackstone's anti-republican emphasis on 
parliamentary omnipotence . . . had no difficulty in accepting the validity of Blackstone's 
exposition of English common law as founded on custom, divine law, and the law of 
nature, hence providing an entirely appropriate legal foundation for the incipient USA."

hand, Aquinas seems to do likewise. See infra note 33.

often will use the latter term instead. In this parlance, the concern 

becomes the charge of incoherence in Blackstone's discussion and use of 

natural law. Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually many 

mistakes -of natural law? 

This article proposes that it is not the Commentaries, but rather its 

critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from 

the expectation that Blackstone's natural law would take after Thomas 

Aquinas's 8 (or even Christopher St.German's) 9 natural law. As Blackstone 

disappoints these expectations, he has met with criticisms that his 

treatment of natural law is a sloppy pro forma performance that even he 

himself does not take seriously. But readers of the Commentaries who 

allow Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable 

treatment that animates the whole of the Commentaries. 

Blackstone's natural law owes much to two influences. The first is 

Roman law, especially as captured in the Corpus Juris Civilis. 10 The second 

is the Anglican church, 11 which is the more distinctive and guides 

Blackstone's response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural 

law as an order immanent in human law, an order especially prominent 

within the common law. Seen in this light, natural law provides the 

foundation for the Commentaries. While doing so, it also provides a 

foundation for understanding law even today, a foundation actually in use 

far more than some might think.

2. THE COMMENTARIES AND THE COMMENTATORS 

After unproductive struggles to develop a successful practice at the bar, 

Blackstone's professional life began to flourish with his Oxford lectures 

on the common law. 12 The Commentaries is not these lectures merely 

recast, delivered as they were to an audience of mere teenagers. 13 

Nevertheless, the Commentaries is designed to teach and Blackstone 

wanted his readers to learn. 14 The readers for whom he wrote were 

"young nobility and gentry," 15 the leading laymen of the realm. 16 Chief 

among these were those who were or would become legislators, and 

Blackstone was determined to instruct them not to harm by statute the 

liberties of Englishmen. 17 

Blackstone's aim to instruct lay readers shaped the Commentaries. 

This aim trained the focus of the Commentaries upon substantive rules of 

law, lending the Commentaries both its pathbreaking distinctive and also 

the daunting obstacle to its creation. 18 Blackstone's object was to teach 

laymen the laws of property, crimes, torts, and such -not how to draft 

legal instruments or plead at bar. 19 Beyond teaching the substance of the 

law to laymen, this substantive-law focus gave "lawyers a new vision of 

the law." 20 The Commentaries imposed order and a clarifying system on the

jumble that was English law. 21 This arrangement was a key to its success. 22 

It is Blackstone's use of natural law that undergirds this arrangement. 23 

Near the beginning of the Commentaries is Blackstone's 

introductory discussion of law. 24 Law is "a rule of action dictated by some 

superior being," and laws considered as rules for human conduct are "the 

precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary beings, a creature 

endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded to make use of 

those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior." 25 The obligation 

to obey law derives from dependence upon the lawgiver, "[a]nd 

consequently as man depends absolutely upon his maker for every thing, 

it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his maker's will. 

THIS will of his maker is called the law of nature." 26 In its scope, 

Blackstone's law of nature reminds one of Aquinas's natural law. 27

See 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 37 (The Legal Classics 
Library 1983) (1765-70) (quoting with approval John Fortescue's endorsement that 
lay students "trace[] up the principles and grounds of the law, even to their original 
elements"). Blackstone's use of natural law in the Commentaries may also reflect his 
own introduction to the law. It was St. German's Doctor and Student, a work integrating 
theological and legal thought, that drew Blackstone to the law. Cook, supra note 12, at 
170. Perhaps for similar reasons, the Commentaries turned students from theology to law.

both for itself and for others. Therefore it has a share of the Eternal Reason, by which it 
has a natural inclination to its due act and end; and this participation of the eternal law in 
the rational creature is called the natural law . . . [T]he natural law is nothing else than 
the rational creature's participation of the eternal law").

The voluntaristic stamp of Blackstone's law of nature -it is the will of 

God -diminishes somewhat in the next words of the Commentaries. 

God's wisdom leads him to prescribe only what corresponds to the nature 

of things and in this he conforms to "the eternal, immutable laws of good 

and evil." 28 Human reason is able to discover these laws, and God's 

goodness leads him to link our happiness with obedience to the law of 

nature. "For he has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven 

the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the 

latter cannot be obtained but by observing the former; and, if the former 

be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter." 29 This link between 

the law of nature and human happiness "is the foundation of what we call 

ethics, or natural law." 30 Natural law comprises articles that "amount to 

no more than demonstrating, that this or that action tends to man's real 

happiness, and therefore very justly concluding that the performance of it 

is a part of the law of nature." 31 

Blackstone then renders explicit the supreme authority of the law of 

nature: 

THIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated 

by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. 

It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: 

no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such 

of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, 

mediately or immediately, from this original. 32 

Again, Blackstone's law of nature brings to mind Aquinas's natural law. 33 

But Blackstone's approach to what he calls natural law differs 

profoundly from that of Aquinas. We already have noted that the

See 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 227-28 (I-II, 95, 2, observing, in an article on the relation 
of "human law" to "natural law," that "every human law has just so much of the character 
of law as it is derived from the law of nature. But if in any point it differs from the law of 
nature, it is no longer a law but a corruption of law.").

[Vol.4:2 2019] 

https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402 

Commentaries describes natural law as a set of demonstrations that 

certain human conduct leads to human happiness and consequently 

comports with the law of nature. 34 This description is nothing like 

Aquinas's description of natural law as the participation of human beings 

in the eternal law, or perhaps vice versa. 35 This difference between 

Blackstone and Aquinas becomes yet clearer in the former's comparison 

of divine law with natural law. 

Although human reason before the Fall sufficed to discover the 

precepts of the law of nature, human reason after the Fall "is corrupt, and 

[human] understanding full of ignorance and error." 36 Therefore, God of 

his compassion has informed us of the law of nature "by . . . immediate 

and direct revelation." 37 "The doctrines thus delivered we call the 

revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy 

scriptures." 38 So the natural law and the divine law both bespeak the law 

of nature. 

Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is (humanly speaking) of 

infinite more authority than what we generally call the natural 

law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly declared so to 

be by God himself; the other is only what, by the assistance of 

human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as

of the Fall upon the operation of the natural law, see also CHARLES E. RICE, 50 QUESTIONS 
ON THE NATURAL LAW 159-63 (1993) and Russell Hittinger, Natural Law and Catholic Moral 
Philosophy, in A PRESERVING GRACE 1, 7-8 (Michael Cromartie ed., 1997). Hittinger finds 
that Aquinas, "[i]n his last recorded remarks on the subject of natural law," said: 
Now although God in creating man gave him this law of nature, 
the devil oversowed another law in man, namely, the law of 
concupiscence. . . . Since then the law of nature was destroyed by 
concupiscence, man needed to be brought back to works of virtue, and 
to be drawn away from vice: for which purpose he needed the written 
law.

Id. In tension with his formulation here, elsewhere in the Commentaries Blackstone will 
write of "divine law, either natural or revealed," 2 id. at 420, and "divine law both natural 
and revealed," id. at 455. In these two instances, it appears that he uses "divine" to denote 
the divine origin of the law of nature rather than to denote divine law proper. So, in yet 
a third place, he writes of "those laws which the creator has given us; the divine laws, I 
mean, of either nature or revelation." 4 id. at 177.

certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an 

equal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any 

competition together. 39 

Natural law is "only what . . . we imagine to be" the law of nature. 40 

The Commentaries continues with further observations on the 

relationship between these laws and human law: 

UPON these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of 

revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human 

laws should be suffered to contradict these. There is, it is true, a 

great number of indifferent points, in which both the divine law 

and the natural leave a man at his own liberty; but which are 

found necessary for the benefit of society to be restrained 

within certain limits. And herein it is that human laws have 

their greatest force and efficacy; for, with regard to such points 

as are not indifferent, human laws are only declaratory of, and 

act in subordination to, the former. 41 

Two elements of this excerpt warrant special notice. First is Blackstone's 

usage of the "law of nature" and the "natural law." As mentioned 

above, 42 his usage sometimes seems to depart from distinguishing the 

two, with natural law as a merely human construct thought to resemble 

the actual law of nature. On one reading, such a departure appears in this 

passage. 
The second element is the connection between matters 

indifferent -matters for which the law of nature does not prescribe a 

specific rule -and human law. While there is a firm link between the 

laws of nature and human law, it appears that human law largely

of nuisance as enforcing "that excellent rule of gospel-morality, of 'doing to others as we 
would they should do unto ourselves,'" 3 id. at 218, and of the criminal law, 4 id. at 11, 30, 
42, 43, 60, including laws against homicide, id. at 177, dueling, id. at 199, and sodomy, 
id. at 216. John Finnis has noted that Blackstone's endorsement of the role divine law is 
to play in the formulation of human law does not lead him to confuse crime with sin. See 
Finnis, supra note 24, at 177. 
See supra note 7.

University of Bologna Law Review 
[Vol.4:2 2019] 

https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402 

concerns itself with matters indifferent. Whereas Aquinas casts human 

law essentially in the position of providing determinations that apply 

rules of the natural law in particular contexts, 43 Blackstone sees human 

law having greatest play where the law of nature appears mute. This 

significant role in his analysis for things indifferent owes a major debt to 

Blackstone's Anglican point of view. 44 

Blackstone's introductory remarks on law and their relation to the 

rest of the Commentaries (and, for that matter, Blackstone's entire 

project) have drawn sharp criticism. It is reported that no less an 

authority than Dr. Johnson remarked that Blackstone "thought clearly, 

but he thought faintly." 45 The Commentaries "is widely believed to rest on 

silly, ponderous, formal, conceptual, outdated, deductive, mechanistic, 

naive and hopelessly unrealistic jurisprudence," 46 to be lacking in rigor, 47 

and apparently riven by inconsistencies. 48 Especially for his effort to 

satisfy the customary requirement of supplying his treatise with a general 

introduction on the law, 49 Blackstone has received much criticism. 50 

Beyond this, Blackstone seems largely to ignore the introductory doctrine 

See 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 209-10 (I-II, 91, 3, observing that, "it is from the precepts 
of the natural law, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that the human reason 
needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular 
determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws . . ."). The Commentaries 
is not wholly lacking this approach. For example: "And sometimes, where the thing itself 
has it's [sic] rise from the law of nature, the particular circumstances and mode of doing 
it become right or wrong, as the laws of the land shall direct." 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 
23, at 55. 
The significant role in the Commentaries for human law to supply rules for matters 
indifferent does not preclude a role for the law of nature (or natural law) in supplying 
specific rules for human law. See, e.g., 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 435-36, 441 
(discussing parents and children); 2 Id. at 390, 392-93 (discussing property in animals); 
4 Id. at 11 (discussing capital punishment), 29 (discussing wife's defense of duress), 
30 (discussing self-defense), 42 (discussing guilt from crime), 67, 117 (discussing 
international law).

HERBERT STUART FIFOOT, LORD MANSFIELD 26 (1936)). The early classic effort to debunk the 
Commentaries is JEREMY BENTHAM, A FRAGMENT ON GOVERNMENT (London, Thomas Payne 
et al. 1776), but Bentham's target is as much the notion of natural law as the Commentaries 
itself. Posner's article explains that Bentham's is a "fundamentally misconceived attack 
on the Commentaries." Id. at 569.

he supplies once his introduction is behind him. 51 H.L.A. Hart has argued 

that Blackstone does not use the law of nature to support English law, and 

that his natural law test of the validity of positive law is vacuous in any 

event. 52 Although these arguments have not gone unanswered, 53 they 

actually point not to defects but rather to the very natural law technique 

Blackstone uses in his discussion of English law in the Commentaries, the 

technique based upon his Anglican understanding. 54 

The Commentaries has suffered at the hands of some commentators. 

The introductory explanation of the law of nature and natural law has been 

a popular target of criticism. So has Blackstone's use -or rather non-use 

-of these elements when he develops his commentaries on the laws of 

England proper. Nevertheless, a more liberal appreciation of his work will 

notice a highly developed and broadly used natural law approach in those 

commentaries. This appreciation, however, must be attuned to discerning

54 McKnight concurs in Hart's view of Blackstone's treatment of the law of nature and sees 
it as making way for Blackstone's focus on indifferent matters. See McKnight, supra 
note 2, at 405. McKnight's understanding also supports, if ironically, the argument that 
Blackstone thereby paves the way for his own brand of natural law analysis. See infra notes 
309-12 and accompanying text. 
Two other criticisms of the Commentaries deserve scant mention here. First, the radical 
critique of Duncan Kennedy, The Structure of Blackstone's Commentaries, 28 BUFF. L. REV. 
205 (1979), that finds Blackstone "supremely unconvincing." Id. at 211. Kennedy's 
critique itself has been found supremely unconvincing. See, e.g., Alschuler, supra note 1, at

350-52 (1984); Watson, supra note 23, at 795, 802. Second, some commentators criticize 
Blackstone on his discussion of absolute rights, as if his use of "absolute" means incapable 
of diminishment or compromise. See, e.g., Lobban, supra note 50, at 329-30; McKnight, 
supra note 2, at 401 n.16. This criticism falls aside upon paying more careful attention to 
Blackstone's usage: 
THE rights of persons considered in their natural capacities are 
also of two sorts, absolute, and relative. Absolute, which are such as 
appertain and belong to particular men, merely as individuals or single 
persons: relative, which are incident to them as members of society, 
and standing in various relations to each other. 
1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 119. "Absolute" means apart from social context, not 
sacrosanct. See Watson, supra note 23, at 803.

a use of the natural law that Blackstone's own introduction may not have 

foretold for his readers today. 

3. BLACKSTONE AND JUSTINIAN 

Before seeing Blackstone as an Anglican it helps to see him as a civilian -

a master of the Corpus Juris Civilis, the body of Roman law assembled 

under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the early sixth century. 55 

Blackstone's own studies at Oxford made him well acquainted with 

Roman law. 56 This acquaintance primed him for cultivating his Anglican 

approach to the natural law, an approach that ends up looking very much 

like that of Justinian. 

As noted already, the Commentaries presents the laws of England 

primarily as a body of substantive law. 57 
This approach enabled 

Blackstone to present the laws as a system, arranging them conceptually 

by categories. 58 In this, the Commentaries resembles the Roman law 

treatises of the ancient jurisconsult Gaius and of Justinian, whose 

Institutes is a component of the Corpus Juris Civilis. 59 The Commentaries has 

been likened to Justinian's work in both content and effect. 60 

For an introduction to Justinian and his work, see Craig A. Stern, Justinian: Lieutenant of 
Christ, Legislator for Christendom, 11 REGENT U. L. REV. 1 (1998). Helmholz has remarked 
that Blackstone was perhaps one-fifth a civilian, R.H. Helmholz, Natural Law and Human 
Rights in English Law: From Bracton to Blackstone, 3 AVE MARIA L. REV. 1, 5 (2005), not so 
small a fraction considering how imbued Blackstone was with the common law. 
See Cook, supra note 12, at 170-72. 
See supra text accompanying note 18. 
See Berring, supra note 16, at 191; Watson, supra note 23, at 810. It may be that Blackstone 
came to this method owing to his "academic persona." Wilfrid Prest, The Religion of a 
Lawyer?: William Blackstone's Anglicanism, 21 PARERGON 153, 158 (2004). 
See Milsom , supra note 18, at 10-11; Watson, supra note 23, at 810 (finding the 
Commentaries to be a "direct descendant of Justinian's Institutes"); see also Cairns, supra 
note 54, at 320, 340, 350, 359 (finding the Commentaries to be largely an "Institutional" 
work). 
See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 3. Others have written that Blackstone's work is 
fundamentally unlike Justinian's, Berman & Reid, supra note 50, at 492-96, or failed 
fundamentally by forcing the content of the common law into an unwelcoming structure 
from Roman law. Lobban, supra note 50, at 312, 321-23.

Like the Commentaries, the Corpus Juris Civilis presents abstract 

introductory discussions of natural law 61 and manifests its actual use of 

natural law in the body of the work, the treatment of the law of Rome. 

Drawing on the universal and supreme authority of natural law, Justinian 

used it to support and explain Roman law. Intent on promulgating law for 

the entire Roman world, Justinian hoped to justify Roman law as 

universal by demonstrating that it reflected universal principles of law. Of 

course, the Emperor looked to support his own legal regime, not to supply 

arguments to criticize or attack it. The dignity and universal authority of 

the natural law lay ready to lend dignity and universal authority to Roman 

law. 62 

Beyond lending this support, the natural law helped explain the 

rules of Roman law. Natural and Roman law were viewed as intertwined, 

so much so that natural law was best seen through existing Roman law, 

the celebrated simplicity and harmony of which derived from this 

relationship. 63 As in classical Greek thought on natural law, natural law 

was understood to be from the "aboriginal design of nature," but Roman 

thinking also understood actual, positive Roman law to approximate the 

ideal natural law, gradually conforming to it more fully. 64 Far from a 

revolutionary doctrine, the Roman natural law approach encouraged 

Roman lawyers to find the natural law in positive law. 65 

In actual operation, Roman natural law concerned itself with 

conforming legal rules to the nature of things. 66 It sought the intrinsic 

character of legal subjects, applying natural reason to the facts of the

matter at hand. 67 A master of both natural law theory and Roman law 

likens this work to developing rules for preparing flaky piecrust. 68 

The Commentaries makes use of natural law in much the same 

way. 69 Far from using natural law to trump the law of England, 70 and only 

rarely using natural law to criticize English law, 71 Blackstone follows the 

Roman natural law tradition in explaining why English law is as it is. 72 

This use is in keeping with Blackstone's practical rather than theoretical 

bent. 73 Like the natural law of the Roman lawyer, 74 Blackstone's natural 

law unites is with ought, seeking norms from the nature of things, 75 but 

with more warrant. 76 

A good example of this technique is offered by Blackstone's 

explanation of the law of property. As Professor Graham has explained, 

the Commentaries does not present irrational support of old ways but 

rather a studied focus on the physical nature of things. 77 From nature and 

the natural order in physical context, for example, Blackstone evolves a 

"natural history" of property to rationalize English property law. 78 . 

Natural law inheres in the nature of things, and the law of England, like

Although it may be that Blackstone never explicitly asserted that one could discover the 
law of nature from English law, or vice versa. McKnight, supra note 2, at 403 n.33. At 
least one commentator has written that the common-law tradition reflects the notion that 
innate reason has led the positive law to hold within itself the natural law. Lobban, supra 
note 50, at 314. Similar to this link is the one Blackstone approvingly found to be advanced 
by Aristotle: learning positive law is a good way to learn ethics. See Conklin, supra note 23,

such criticism.

Roman law, developed in light of this natural law. 79 

The Commentaries holds many instances where Blackstone 

explicitly explains that English law is true to the nature of things -

sometimes presented as fulfilling the obligation of the law to reflect 

"necessity." This, after he notes that the law of nature inheres in the 

nature of things, 80 and that sound Roman laws took "the nature of things 

for their guide." 81 Some examples: Blackstone establishes the obligation 

of allegiance to civil government upon the nature of civil government. 82 

The legal relationship between husband and wife is founded in nature. 83 

Necessity has given rise to the law of property, 84 and laws on personal 

property take into account their transitory nature. 85 The laws of civil 

wrongs derive in several respects from the nature of things, often human 

nature, 86 and criminal laws likewise derive from the nature of things or 

reflect the nature of things. 87 In these instances, Blackstone seems to 

hark back to the Roman law, rooted as it was in the nature of things. 

Roman law makes its appearance in the Commentaries in at least 

two other general ways that support Blackstone's Anglican approach to 

the law. First is its concept of the jus gentium, the law of nations. If the 

natural law truly is universal, one would expect it -or projections from it 

-to be found in the laws of all nations. The law of nations, understood as 

the body of laws to be found widespread among the nations of the earth, 

therefore becomes a window on natural law, as the Romans believed. 88 

The Commentaries suggests that natural law inheres in the nature of things in such 
language as, "when the supreme being formed the universe, and created matter out 
of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter, from which it can never 
depart, and without which it would cease to be." 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 38. If 
Blackstone tags the law of property as governing things indifferent, see infra note 152 and 
accompanying text, he does not thereby hold that property law is wholly without natural 
law principles. See infra notes 309-12 and accompanying text.

https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402 

This value of the jus gentium is evident in Blackstone's use of 

comparative law. He looks to law outside England not so much to 

disparage non-English law as to find points of commonality. Those 

points support English law by suggesting that it rests upon natural law 

foundations. 89 A similar cast in Anglican theology could therefore offer a 

link and support to Blackstone's approach to the law. 

Beyond its content, another aspect of Roman law that influenced 

the Commentaries and would harmonize well with an Anglican 

understanding of the law is the process of the development of Roman law. 

Roman law developed over hundreds of years, largely case by case. 90 In 

this respect, its development paralleled that of English common law. 

While Roman law came to repose nearly exclusively in the Corpus Juris 

Civilis, 91 English law rejected such codification in favor of its commitment 

to the method by which Roman law developed. 92 Some have noted that 

Blackstone took the view of a practicing lawyer and judge in the 

Commentaries, 93 and though it was famously said that, "In England less 

attention is paid to natural law than anywhere else in the world," 94 

Blackstone used natural law arguments successfully at the bar. 95 The 

common law -the law of cases -required barristers and judges to 

consider cases with an eye to their context. This technique largely 

provided the materials Blackstone assembled in the Commentaries. It is a 

technique that befits the Anglican way, a technique that developed law 

that itself befits the Anglican way. It also was the way of Roman lawyers.

BEFORE THE TIME OF EDWARD I 585 (Liberty Fund, Inc. 2010) (1898). So the English were

rather than adhering to the method by which Roman law developed. Id. at 705.

If common law judges in deciding cases were making law up, they were 

making it up to fit. 96 

Blackstone, student of Roman law, reflected a Roman law approach 

to the natural law in the Commentaries. Beginning, like the Digest and 

Institutes of the Corpus Juris Civilis, with an abstract exposition of natural 

law and related formulations, the body of the Commentaries puts natural 

law most to use in explaining and justifying particular rules of law. 

Seeking the dictates of reason and the guide of reasonableness, 

Blackstone rests rules of law upon the nature of the matter at hand -a 

typically Roman technique. In this and other respects, Blackstone's use of 

natural law fits well with the Anglican stance on natural law that he 

adopts in the Commentaries. 

4. BLACKSTONE AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND 

No surprise that Sir William Blackstone, Oxford don, justice of both the 

King's Bench and Common Pleas, was an Anglican. What may surprise is 

how serious an Anglican Blackstone was, and how deeply his Anglicanism 

influenced the jurisprudence of his Commentaries. 

Blackstone's deep and pervasive Christian faith was manifest. 97 As 

a young man he took a serious interest in religion, 98 and made a careful 

investigation 
of 
Anglicanism 99 
before 
committing 
himself 

wholeheartedly to orthodox Anglicanism. 100 
He celebrated his 

commitment in a poem, a vision of diverse faiths in which he praised the 

Church of England for its moderation, liberty, support of science, 

See Milsom, supra note 18, at 11-12. Milsom here speaks of fit according to patterns of legal 
rules, but the notion of judges in a sense creating rules that at the same time are seen as 
compelled by antecedent norms is apropos.

reforming influence, and virtue. 101 Although a committed Anglican, 

Blackstone was not so committed that he could brook no Dissenters, 102 

going so far as to alter the Commentaries in light of Dissenter reaction to 

an earlier edition of the work. 103 The general Anglican understanding of 

providential development from primitive sources 104 and the important 

role reason plays in perceiving truth 105 would support Blackstone's 

construction of the Commentaries. 

The substantial alignments between Anglican theology and the 

Commentaries are the focus of the next pages of this article. 

4.1. RICHARD HOOKER 

Key to the Church of England is the work of the Elizabethan divine, 

Richard Hooker. 106 Beyond helping to shape the contours of Anglicanism 

as a whole, Hooker's influence on legal theory was especially 

pronounced. 107 
Blackstone's Anglican understanding of the law 

necessarily reflects Hooker's understanding. 

Hooker held law in high esteem: 

[O]f Law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is 

the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world: all things 

in heaven and in earth do her homage, the very least as feeling 

her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power: both 

Angels and men and creatures of what condition soever, though 

See WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, THE PANTHEON 27-32 (photo. reprint, Gale ECCO Print Editions 
2010) (1747). Prest has called Blackstone a "comparative theologian." Prest, supra note 3,

See Raymond D. Tumbleson, "Reason and Religion": The Science of Anglicanism, 57 J. HIST. 
IDEAS 131, 133, 151 (1996). 
106 See NIGEL ATKINSON, RICHARD HOOKER AND THE AUTHORITY OF SCRIPTURE, TRADITION AND 
REASON, at ix (1997). Though such, his work earned surprising approval from the leader of 
the Roman Catholic Church. See RUSSELL KIRK, THE ROOTS OF AMERICAN ORDER 246 (1974). 
Harold Berman highlights Hooker's influence as to political authority and consent, 
the importance of history, and the large role played by matters indifferent-those not 
determined by transcendent sources of law. See Harold J. Berman, The Origins of Historical 
Jurisprudence: Coke, Selden, Hale, 103 YALE L.J. 1651, 1665-66 (1994).

each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent, 

admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy. 108 

Law for Hooker is fundamental. 109 Furthermore, his treatment of law is 

no incidental matter but derives from his theology. 110 Law, as one might 

gather from the excerpt just quoted, reigns over politics. In this, Hooker 

departs from an Aristotelian view, 111 and follows, as elsewhere, the 

magisterial reformers rather than Augustine or Aquinas. 112 

Hooker goes so far as to hold that God himself works according to 

law, 113 and for at least one commentator, Hooker holds that God is law. 114 A 

famous apothegm of Hooker states that "the being of God is a kind of law 

to his working." 115 

In some respects, Hooker's general discussion of the fundamental 

types of law adumbrates that of Blackstone. Hooker explains that, in his 

usage, both the law of nature and divine law reveal eternal law to 

humankind. 116 At the same time, however, Hooker holds divine law to be 

positive law, a creature of God's reason and will both, whereas for 

Blackstone it is simply a revelation of the law of nature. 117 Likewise, 

Hooker sees some human law as an adaptation of natural law, and other 

human law as an ordinance "merely human," reasonable and convenient

"positive" if express revelation is necessary to know it. 1 HOOKER, supra note 108, at 220 
n.1. Also, apparently unlike Blackstone, Hooker observes that the evidence of the senses 
is clear and strong while that of revelation is complicated and complex. THORNTON, supra, 
at 16. At the same time, however, the object held out in the Scriptures is more certain than 
that in the senses. Id. at 18.

for the time and place. 118 A similar formulation of human law will find its 

way into the Commentaries. 119 

The line from Hooker to Blackstone is more clearly traced along 

particular elements to be found in the works of both. One is the role of 

human reason in the development of law. 120 Like other Reformation 

theologians, Hooker asserts that Scripture and reason both convey to 

humans the knowledge of God and of his eternal law. 121 "It was part of 

God's nature to work in an orderly and reasonable way . . . ." 122 

Consequently, "God's own creation also worked in an orderly and 

reasonable way," 123 a way ruled by law. God acts to accomplish his 

"rational purpose." 124 So for Hooker, the appeal to reason becomes 

key. 125 The law of reason is for all humans, 126 endowed as they are with "a 

natural practical wisdom." 127 Humans find themselves ruled by the law of 

reason, divine law, and human law 128 -the last resting upon rational 

human nature 129 and either resolving "probable matters" or "clarify[ing] 

NIGEL VOAK, RICHARD HOOKER AND REFORMED THEOLOGY 117 (2003); see also FAULKNER, supra 
note 111, at 114 (reading Hooker to state that human law is discovered naturally, but 
that the authority to do so is from God); Rowan Williams, Foreword: Of the Lawes of 
Ecclesiastical Politie Revisited, in A COMPANION TO RICHARD HOOKER, supra note 113, at xv, 
xviii-xix (distinguishing in Hooker laws for humanity from laws for particular societies, 
with both legitimate and binding). 
See infra notes 305-12 and accompanying text. Also finding its way into the Commentaries 
is Hooker's usage of the term lex gentium to mean international law rather than something 
like the Roman usage of jus gentium discussed above at notes 88 to 89. Finnis, supra note 
24, at 177. 
120 Of course, some role for human reason is found in standard views on the making of law, 
with perhaps the classic being that of Aquinas. See, e.g., supra note 43. Nevertheless, the 
uses to which Hooker and Blackstone put reason bear a special affinity, as discussed below.

reason"), 76 ("The concept of natural law, and its derivative-the law of reason, played a 
central role in the thought of Richard Hooker . . . .").

and enforc[ing] the necessary precepts of reason." 130 The authority 

Hooker grants to human reason, a touchstone of Anglicanism, holds sway 

in the Commentaries, as shall appear. 131 

A second major influence of Hooker upon Blackstone is his 

endorsement of the authority of custom. Against the Puritan threat of 

"singularity," lack of consensus, 132 Hooker counterpoised consent, 133 a 

distant consent presumed to continue. 134 Custom, modified appropriately 

by customarily legitimate written law, is authoritative and likely to induce 

obedience. 135 This appreciation for custom fits well with Hooker's view 

that God teaches through human experience. 136 
It also supports 

Blackstone's hailing custom as the common law, a move that enabled him 

to capture the advantages of both primitive sources and traditional 

developments. 137 

Third is the related matter of Hooker's use of history. For Hooker, 

Scripture supports the value of experience. 138 Joined with his notion that 

God delivers law providentially, 139 these views support Hooker's position 

that attaining truth is a gradual affair played out in history. 140 Humans may 

make laws, but in a sense those laws are God's as he works his providential 

will. 141 History as the unfolding of gradual development 142 is normative 

for Hooker. 143 Consequently, Harold Berman has found in Hooker a key to 

English historical jurisprudence and its continuing influence 144 as well as

an emphasis on historical continuity. 145 For Blackstone, history is the key 

to understanding English law. 146 

The last marked influence of Hooker on Blackstone is the 

importance of the concept of things indifferent, matters not conclusively 

ordained by transcendent law but rather left more to human 

determination. 147 Positive laws may resolve matters that God leaves to 

human liberty. 148 So, while some human laws are based upon natural 

law, 149 its necessary tenets are few, leaving most matters to public 

authority. 150 Blackstone takes a similar tack 151 : Daniel Boorstin has 

discussed the remarkable degree to which Blackstone holds that private 

property itself is a creature of civil law. 152 Crimes not mala in se but rather 

those "with regard to things in themselves indifferent . . . become either 

right or wrong, just or unjust, duties or misdemeanors, according as the 

municipal legislator sees proper." 153 "Lands are not naturally descendible 

any more than thrones: but the law has thought proper, for the benefit 

and peace of the public, to establish hereditary succession in one as well 

See id. at 1666. 
See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 36; LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 42; Conklin, supra note 23, 
at 218. Lobban finds in Blackstone a commitment to authority and history over deductive 
reasoning, see Lobban, supra note 50, at 328, and views the Commentaries as intertwining 
theory with history. Id. at 330. And Boorstin finds a telling example of Blackstone's 
commitment to history in his treatment of the Revolution of 1688. BOORSTIN, supra note 1,

See FAULKNER, supra note 111, at 113; see also id. at 100 (observing that, after the law 
of reason, human law holds prominence for Hooker), 112 (observing that, once natural 
necessity calls for a rule, nearly any rule will do). 
151 While for Blackstone "indifferent" can mean diverse things, Finnis, supra note 24, 
at 172-73, Blackstone imitates Hooker on biblical law, for example, acceding to its 
authority but finding its still-obligatory moral law pertinent to very few issues. See 
D. SEABORN DAVIES, THE BIBLE IN ENGLISH LAW 20 (1954). As to one such instance, it is 
both intriguing and relevant to note that Blackstone observes that blood guilt-a concept 
harking back to biblical standards-would adhere to Parliament were it to over-extend 
capital punishment. 4 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 11. The Bible also speaks specifically 
of blood guilt for over-extension of capital punishment. See DEUTERONOMY 19:4-10. See 
generally Craig A. Stern, Torah and Murder: The Cities of Refuge and Anglo-American Law,

as the other." 154 Regarding the jurisdiction of courts, "[e]very nation 

must and will abide by it's [sic] own municipal laws; which various 

accidents conspire to render different in almost every country in 

Europe." 155 Apart from these specific observations regarding indifferent 

matters, Blackstone's chief use of natural law paradoxically guides the 

resolution of matters that, in a sense, are indifferent. 156 More on this use 

later. 157 

The teaching of Hooker was not lost on the English legal theorists 

that followed. Edward Coke viewed the law as reason in history -reason 

in the sense of reasonable, not rationalistic -and understood that 

natural law was incorporated into human law. 158 Even more than Coke, 

Matthew Hale especially influenced Blackstone in the Commentaries. 159 

Like Hooker, Hale saw natural law and divine law as authoritative but also 

as speaking only to a limited set of questions. 160 
Likewise, Hale 

understood history as providence, 161 with positive law accordingly 

developed through time. 162 This historical focus finds its way from Hale 

into the Commentaries. 163 Also, both Hale's locating reason within a 

particular object (in addition to its being a human faculty) and his debt to 

natural science and empiricism 164 seem reflected in the Commentaries. 165 

The Anglicanism of Hooker, Coke, and Hale, and their emphasis on 

reason and history alongside the authority of natural law and Holy Writ, 

are to be seen in Blackstone's Commentaries. An even clearer influence on

Blackstone, however, is Anglican thought closer to his own time. It is to 

that thought that we now turn. 

4.2. THE LATITUDINARIANS 

The Anglican Church faced the Age of Reason and Deism with 

Latitudinarianism. 166 
Though standing in opposition to those two 

developments, the Latitudinarians, as their name implies, embraced 

tolerance as their major theme. 167 This theme in no way compromised 

their commitment to God and the Christian faith. The Latitudinarians 

believed that God holds an absolute claim on humanity and that all our 

powers depend upon his will. 168 Christianity is to govern all of life. 169 

Education for moral and spiritual reformation is especially important. 170 

With these tenets Latitudinarianism was a major force in seventeenth 

century Anglicanism. 

It also was in important respects a movement in continuity with 

the work of Hooker, a continuity that would support the work of 

Blackstone. The Latitudinarians in their tolerance relied upon Hooker's 

emphasis on things indifferent. 171 
They also shared Hooker's 

endorsement of strong laws. 172 

Beyond these particulars, the most important influence of 

Latitudinarianism to be seen in the Commentaries, and well within the 

trajectory Hooker set for the Anglican Church, was its appreciation for 

reason as a guide in human affairs. Latitudinarian thought was well

see id. at 118-19, 122.

suited to the development of science 173 : it is no accident that Isaac 

Newton was an Anglican. 174 The Latitudinarians understood that human 

reason did not survive the Fall unimpaired. 175 At the same time, however, 

some power of human reason persists. 176 Human reason under God is able 

to understand nature, itself existing under the Sovereign God. 177 This 

human reason is not the reason of rationalism, but instead more like 

common sense. 178 And just as reason is an aid to understanding the 

Bible, 179 so is the Bible a necessary aid to the use of reason. 180 

Latitudinarians favored reason and the philosophical explanation of 

reality, 181 but more important to Blackstone's jurisprudence was their 

view that reason was useful especially for discerning natural law. 182 

One who could be viewed as the leading exponent of 

Latitudinarianism in the next century, the century of Blackstone, is 

Bishop Joseph Butler. 183 Butler published his most important work, The 

Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed, in 1736 and it became hugely 

influential in the middle of the century during the height of Blackstone's 

career and the writing of the Commentaries. 184 Relying on the same 

principles that served Hooker, 185 Butler aimed to refute the deists on the 

grounds of natural theology. 186 
As Blackstone would argue, 187 the

See Jacob & Jacob, supra note 173, at 254, 262, 265. The Anglican mix of authority from the

creature owes a duty to the creator, and design proves a designer. 188 

Likewise, general laws govern nature, 189 with the nature of things giving 

rise to right and wrong, thus determining God's will. 190 Humans are able 

to discover their duties through reason -more the reasonable dictate of 

God's will than the deliverances of logic. 191 Blackstone would also endorse 

Butler's view of civil government as an agency of God's government 

concerned with social consequences. 192 

Two major aspects of Butler's theology to lodge in the Commentaries 

command attention here. The first is emphasis on experience. We have 

noted Butler's emphasis on reason, that is on reasonableness more than 

cold logic. 193 Nevertheless, humankind cannot by speculation judge what 

leads to human perfection or happiness. 194 Hooker had held that the degree 

of certainty we attain is relative to the nature of things. 195 Like him, Butler 

held that we should not expect to plumb the depths of all knowledge and 

understanding, but rather follow the light we do have. 196 

That light largely is the product of experience. The laws by which 

God governs are known to us by reason along with experience. 197 As 

science and medicine developed by progressive advances, 198 so ethics 

depends upon empirical evidence and common sense, and morality itself

is a science of human action with attention paid to the facts of results. 199 

God uses our experience to teach us duties. 200 As with physics, so with 

human laws, experiment, inductive method, and judgment based upon 

the generality of observations are sound guides. 201 Experience, resting 

upon God's governance by punishment and reward, 202 is a surer guide 

than abstract reason. 203 

Blackstone suited the Commentaries to his readers, enlightened 

eighteenth-century Anglicans. 204 He himself was committed to English 

enlightenment principles 205 and Butler's welcome to progress, 

knowledge, and experience 206 suited Blackstone well. Like Edmund 

Burke, 207 Blackstone embraced Latitudinarianism and the work of Joseph 

Butler. 208 He subscribed to the test of probability rather than certainty, 209

outcome of such a move.

epistemology and the role of happiness. 
See Blackstone's probabilism here, for example: "But this [move of the Restoration 
Parliament] was for the necessity of the thing, which supersedes all law; for if they had 
not so met, it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been settled in peace." 
1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 147 (emphasis added). And here: "So that it is morally 
impossible to trace out, with any degree of accuracy, when the several mutations of the 
common law were made . . . ." 4 id. at 402 (first emphasis added). The probabilism in 
this use of "morally impossible" finds an explanation from Blackstone's contemporary, 
Samuel Johnson: 
He thus defined the difference between physical and moral truth: 
"Physical truth is, when you tell a thing as it actually is. Moral truth 
is, when you tell a thing sincerely and precisely as it appears to you. 
I say such a one walked across the street; if he really did so, I told a 
physical truth. If I thought so, though I should have been mistaken, I 
told a moral truth."

https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402 

reasonableness as a touchstone of truth, 210 and common sense coupled 

with experience. 211 The large role in the Commentaries played by history 

may be ascribed, at least in part, to this regard for experience. 212 

A second aspect of Butler's theology that helped shape the 

Commentaries is the importance and function of human happiness. 213 God 

governs mankind by reward, by the consequences of human actions. 214 

Therefore, true happiness directs us towards doing God's will. 215 This 

happiness (supplemented by conscience 216 ) defies certain demonstration, 

but does make itself known with "practical proof." 217 To pursue virtue is 

to pursue happiness, and to pursue happiness is to pursue virtue. 218 

Again, Blackstone concurs with Butler in his argument that God has 

ordered human affairs so that we need only pursue our own happiness to 

find ourselves pursuing the law of nature that God has established for the 

right ordering of our affairs. 219 For both Butler and Blackstone, reasonable 

self-love motivates us to adhere to God's rule. 220 So here too, Blackstone 

shows himself in the Commentaries aligning with the work of Butler as he 

aligns with other elements of the Anglican tradition. 

Blackstone had every reason to write the Commentaries from an 

Anglican point of view. It was good rhetoric for reaching his intended 

See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 23. 
211 See id. 55, 117-19. In these last commitments, Blackstone owed a debt also to Locke, id. at

See Butler, supra note 188, at xxx, 36, 56, 61, 72, 93, 112, 268-70; BUTLER, supra note 196, at

Alschuler, supra note 1, at 52. 
Compare BUTLER, supra note 196, at 68 (for Butler) with BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 53 (for 
Blackstone). Conklin also finds that the pursuit of happiness is a linchpin for Blackstone, 
Conklin, supra note 23, at 224, 260, but she places his approach also within the Common 
Sense school, id. at 215-17. She attributes the phrase "the pursuit of happiness" in the 
Declaration of Independence to Blackstone. Id. at 200-02. But see Craig A. Stern & Gregory

audience. It was true to his own convictions. We have seen thus far 

particular elements of the Commentaries signaling Blackstone's Anglican 

approach. The main topic of this article, however, is his use of natural 

law-the concept and body of transcendent law-and the degree to which 

Blackstone's Anglican understanding shapes this use. 

5. THE ANGLICAN BLACKSTONE AND THE NATURAL LAW 

As we have seen, Blackstone's Commentaries bears the impress of its 

author's Anglican faith. This impress shapes the appearance of natural 

law in the Commentaries, but by no means minimizes the role of natural 

law. To be sure, if using natural law means using it as Aquinas used it, 

Blackstone does not use natural law. 221 In fact, Anglican Blackstone 

lodges criticism at the scholastic tradition. 222 But the use of natural law, a 

transcendent norm that guides human law, may transcend Aquinas's use. 

In fact, the Commentaries more than anything takes the common law back 

to natural law, to first principles, 223 portraying the common law as 

blended with the natural law into one body. 224 Its use of natural law is not 

While Blackstone does subscribe to the notion that natural law bounds the validity of 
human law, see supra text accompanying notes 32, 41; Posner, supra note 45, at 605, his 
use of natural law embraces far more, Finnis, supra note 24, at 183. 
See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 78; see also 2 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 58 (describing 
the "ingenuity" of the middle ages as one "which perplexed all theology with the subtilty 
of scholastic disquisitions, and bewildered philosophy in the mazes of metaphysical 
jargon"); 4 id. at 410-11 (bemoaning the scholastic intricacies of Norman jurisprudence). 
Blackstone's approach avoided the complexities of the scholastics. See Conklin, supra 
note 23, at 224. At the same time, while some note Blackstone's modern emphasis on 
individual rights rather than on the classic common good, Finnis, supra note 24, at 181, 
and on peace as the end of civil society, BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 179, and his "social" 
rather than philosophical consistency, Brinton, supra note 204, at 704, Blackstone does 
hold that society has a "moral purpose," BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 190, and shares also 
with Aquinas, see, e.g., 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 213-14 (I-II, 92, 1), 232-33 (I-II, 96, 
3), the belief that law has moral content, teaches right and wrong, and improves human 
beings. See 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 27, 45; 2 id. at 8; 3 id. at 162. 
See Conklin, supra note 23, at 211. 
224 Cf. Helmholz, supra note 55, at 21-22 (noting that English lawyers traditionally assumed 
that the common law and natural law "complemented each other"). But see Allen, supra 
note 21, at 196-98 (questioning the impact of natural law upon the Commentaries).

muddled or unnecessary. 225 After its conventional introductory treatment 

of natural law 226 it frequently adverts to natural law principles when 

discussing the common law itself. 227 Blackstone held that the natural law 

was the only sure guide to English law. 228 Desiring not just to understand 

but also to admire, 229 he sought beauty in the law, a beauty lent to English 

law by God's design in natural law. 230 The Commentaries continuously 

pursues this project and shapes its discussion from principles, 231 being 

structured to align positive law with natural law 232 and organized to 

demonstrate order in the English law from divine simplicity. 233 While it 

melded law and equity together into one overall, integral system, 234 it 

treated not the whole of the common law, but rather only what was 

susceptible of rational appreciation. 235 

The integral connection in the Commentaries between English law 

and natural law constituted English law a handbook on natural law. As the 

spirit of law is a product of natural law, 236 so natural law can be seen from 

the laws of England. 237 At the same time, English common law contained 

a strong cultural component, 238 adapted as it was "to the genius of the

English nation." 239 Taking liberty as the signal English virtue led, as we 

shall see, only to emphasizing all the more the importance of natural law 

to the laws of England. 240 

The Anglican context lent Blackstone's natural law an empirical 

cast akin to Sir Isaac Newton's physics. 241 His approach was descriptive, 

not deductive. 242 Blackstone was not unaware of the dangers of arguing 

from particular to general, 243 but he nonetheless endorsed the scientific 

approach. 244 The Commentaries is a quest for reasonableness, for the 

rational principles -the natural law -undergirding the positive 

particulars of English common law. 245 Because law is a rational science, 

natural law suffuses the text. 246 In this commitment to empirical science 

for fleshing out the natural law embedded in English law, Blackstone 

treats law much as Butler treated theology. 

Hooker more than Butler animates Blackstone's emphasis on 

history, but that emphasis likewise demonstrates an Anglican approach to 

natural law. 247 It is in progressive human experience that Providence 

gradually works the natural law into human law. 248 As with Burke's view, 

natural law makes itself known in history. 249 But history is no sure

roots in Roman law complement his Anglicanism.

guarantee that the human law has taken on its shape from natural law. 

Blackstone held that awkward complexity too comes from history, 250 and 

history must bow to reason if found to contradict it. 251 Nevertheless, 

Blackstone held history both descriptive of the law and prescriptive, 252 

obviating the need to distinguish "historical explanation" from "moral 

justification." 253 The providential, historical development of the law 

enabled Blackstone to portray law as possessing both the appropriate 

degree of fixity and the appropriate degree of change. On the one hand, 

common law and justice itself are fixed and uniform. 254 On the other 

hand, natural law leads to growth and change in the law, 255 and it is 

susceptible of diverse interpretations. 256 
Far from his being an 

uncompromising apologist for the status quo, 257 Blackstone's very 

commitment to history also committed him to progress. 258 Correction 

and improvement -in continuity with historical development -are 

welcome. 259 Accordingly, the Commentaries ends with this charge: 

We have taken occasion to admire at every turn the noble 

monuments of antient simplicity, and the more curious 

refinements of modern art. Nor have it's [sic; i.e., that of the 

body of English law] faults been concealed from view; for faults 

See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 104. 
251 See LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 45. Boorstin writes that Blackstone employs a fiction that 
English law expresses both "the perfection of reason" and "the fullness of experience," 
BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 135, but Blackstone asserts that legal customs, while often 
rooted in natural law, are not always reasonable and so may stand in need of correction. 
Compare, e.g., 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 251 (suggesting that a custom "seems 
dictated by nature herself") with id. at 280 (observing how an ancient rule of common law 
"was consonant neither to reason nor humanity" and so endorsing its later alteration).

treatment of the law. Berman & Reid, supra note 50, at 438.

fixed, and unchangeable, unless by authority of parliament"); 3 id. at 429 (observing 
that "truth and justice are always uniform"). Langbein suggests that Blackstone himself 
viewed the fixed and settled character of the law as a myth. Langbein, supra note 14, at 68.

it has, lest we should be tempted to think it of more than 

human structure: defects, chiefly arising from the decays of 

time, or the rage of unskilful [sic] improvements in later ages. 

To sustain, to repair, to beautify this noble pile, is a charge 

intrusted principally to the nobility, and such gentlemen of the 

kingdom, as are delegated by their country to parliament. The 

protection of THE LIBERTY OF BRITAIN is a duty which they 

owe to themselves, who enjoy it; to their ancestors, who 

transmitted it down; and to their posterity, who will claim at 

their hands this, the best birthright, and noblest inheritance of 

mankind. 260 

As the common law embodies and expresses the natural law, it is to be 

reformed when lapses from that transcendent standard appear. 

Blackstone calls English law of "human structure." 
Though 

eighteenth-century English lawyers may have called their law "the 

perfection of reason," 261 Blackstone acknowledges it to be a somewhat 

faulty human application of natural law, 262 sometimes more honored in 

the breach. 263 

One means of developing the law with both Anglican continuity 

and an eye to the principles of natural law is by legal fiction. 264 

Blackstone held that legal fictions permit the law to do justice in changed 

circumstances, 265 as in bypassing Norman errors. 266 
In the 

Commentaries, fictions, along with history, ground the law. 267 Legal

point of fictions is to shape this fabric more accurately to reflect the way things really are

fictions enable the common law to embody the principles of the natural 

law. 268 

Of course, statutes also might help the law embody the principles 

of natural law. 269 To some degree, the Commentaries portrays statutes as 

declaring the natural law, 270 lending necessary correction to the common 

law while simultaneously rooted in the common law. 271 But statutes 

present a danger: 

THE mischiefs that have arisen to the public from 

inconsiderate alterations in our laws, are too obvious to be 

called in question; and how far they have been owing to the 

defective education of our senators, is a point well worthy of 

the public attention. The common law of England has fared like 

other venerable edifices of antiquity, which rash and 

unexperienced workmen have ventured to new-dress and 

refine, with all the rage of modern improvement. Hence 

frequently it's [sic] symmetry has been destroyed, it's [sic] 

proportions distorted, and it's [sic] majestic simplicity 

exchanged for specious embellishments and fantastic 

novelties. 272 

Architecture was important to Blackstone. 273 As a "rule-bound art," it 

attracted his keen interest. 274 He used architectural metaphors in the 

Commentaries, 275 and elsewhere portrayed the old common law as a 

well-designed building. 276 
Damning accusation it was, then, for 

See, e.g., Stretton, supra note 205, at 119-20, 122, 126-27 (casting Blackstone's (?) "one 
person" theory of marriage as a legal fiction to serve his "scientific organizing principle" 
though, according to Stretton, not directly dictated by natural law).

Blackstone to picture some statutes as monstrous add-ons. 277 But the 

fault of such statutes is that they are in a sense ahistorical -they reflect 

"visionary schemes" and "have not the foundation of the common law to 

build on." 278 Statutes that bring the law closer to the natural law will find 

their basis not in imagined exploits but rather in the principles already to 

be found in the common law itself, the generally trustworthy, if 

imperfect, presentation of the natural law. 

Blackstone's commitment to the common law as holding within it 

immanent natural law reflects both the Roman law and also the Roman 

notion that the jus gentium, the law of nations, is a sound guide to the 

content of the natural law. 279 While the common law may embody the 

natural law more perfectly than do other systems of human law, those 

other systems may shed light on the natural law to be found within the 

common law. Blackstone subscribed to the uniformity of human nature 

and God's purpose, to the consequent uniformity of natural law, and to 

the expectation that the laws of all nations, past and present, would 

reflect these truths. 280 Comparative law illuminates the universality of 

English legal principles, the deposit of natural law. 281 The Age of Reason 

looked for the natural law in the jus gentium, 282 and the Commentaries 

looks to other legal systems to help find reason in the English law. 283 In 

the spirit of Hooker, Blackstone found natural law principles behind the 

diversity of laws even on aspects indifferent under the natural law. And in 

the spirit of Butler, he found marks of reasonableness in the similarity of 

English law to the law of other nations. 
(The dominant role of 

reasonableness in the Commentaries occupies our attention soon.)

The Bible itself often found its way into the Commentaries under the 

aspect of comparative law -again, this was similar to the approach of 

Hooker. 284 Blackstone kept the Bible close to him while writing the 

Commentaries, 285 and he considered the divine law to be found therein the 

authoritative source on what he called the "law of nature" 286 and on the 

development of legal rules and doctrine. 287 Most typically, however, he 

used the Bible as a source of comparative law, a source presenting a body 

of law perfectly devised to embrace the natural law for a specific people at 

a specific time. 288 Natural law then was to be found within biblical law 

and not to be identified with it in its particulars. 289 

In these diverse ways -from finding natural law embedded within 

the common law, to the use of science, history, and comparative law -

the Commentaries takes account of natural law in its treatment of English 

law, all in keeping with an Anglican understanding of natural law and its 

application to human affairs. But the most distinctively Anglican feature 

of how the Commentaries treats the natural law has escaped for the most 

part our attention until now. That feature is the testing and justification 

of the law of England by its reasonableness. Hooker, and especially Butler 

and the Latitudinarians, lent to Anglican theology its distinct emphasis 

on reasonableness. It is in this aspect of his jurisprudence that Blackstone 

most shows himself an Anglican. 

For Blackstone, natural law does not dictate the content of most 

human law. 290 It supplies a few core principles, and those few do not

See Cook, supra note 12, at 175. 
See supra text accompanying note 39. Again, this paper uses the term "natural law" for

be uniform on this point, see supra note 7.

fundamentally overbear human law. 291 Furthermore, the state of civil 

society itself modifies primordial natural law, introducing a context 

where natural law principles take on a different cast or a subservient 

role. 292 For Blackstone, the application of natural law is not so much a 

matter of tracing specific precepts in human law. Rather, it is more like 

the practice of Roman lawyers, finding reasonable and appropriate legal 

norms suited to the situation at hand -the nature of the thing. The 

Commentaries presents the common law as a "rational, integrated" 

system, but also consistently traces its reasonableness, the reasons 

behind its details. 293 

The quest for life in accordance with nature, and therefore with 

reason, was a mark of the Age of Reason. 294 But Blackstone sought 

reasons for the law as a mark of God's own perfection, to be discerned 

through human experience. 295 
Blackstone derived his passion for 

"reasonableness" in the law, and the consequent searching out of reasons 

for the law, from his Anglican theology. 296 
The very core of the 

Commentaries is this essential use of natural law, this examination of 

reasonableness in light of the way things are. Reasons for the law, reasons 

resting upon on fundamental principles, animate the Commentaries. 297

longed served as a touchstone of English law. See NORMAN DOE, FUNDAMENTAL AUTHORITY 
IN LATE MEDIEVAL ENGLISH LAW 83, 106-31, 153, 176-77 (1990). Blackstone no doubt draws 
upon this tradition as well as upon post-Reformation Anglicanism.

"utilitarianism" in the Roman law, McKnight, supra note 2, at 406 n.67. Finnis notes 
that Blackstone in some respects bases even the human institution of rights upon reason.

Throughout the Commentaries, Blackstone weighs law against the standard 

of reasonableness. 298 The weighing is not rigorous. Fallen humans cannot 

understand all by reason, and the reason for some law may now evade our 

discovery. 299 It is enough that the law not be contrary to reason: 300 

[W]hat is not reason is not law. Not that the particular reason 

of every rule in the law can at this distance of time be always 

precisely assigned; but it is sufficient that there be nothing in 

the rule flatly contradictory to reason, and then the law will 

presume it to be well founded. 301 

Most often, however, the Commentaries highlights the place of reason in 

the formulation of the law and supports the reasonableness of its rules. 302 

Furthermore, the Commentaries endorses reasonableness in interpreting 

laws according to their equity, reason, and justice. 303 This overall 

emphasis on reasonableness in the law, seeking sound reasons for rules 

and for their proper application, largely shapes the Commentaries. 304 

Blackstone thought human law most significant on matters 

indifferent, taking full advantage of the Anglican tradition regarding such 

matters, an essential contribution of Hooker. 305 But though "indifferent" 

may describe a matter not dictated by a precept of natural law, it does not 

describe a matter to be determined by human will undirected by reason. 

Support for this proposition derives from Blackstone's theory of natural 

rights. We already have noticed the emphasis Blackstone placed upon 

Lobban describes this as supplying a natural law "external test of reasonableness of the 
law." Lobban, supra note 50, at 333.

liberty as a mark of English culture. 306 Liberty -personal freedom -is 

so important that only reasonable constraint upon it is licit. 307 "[L]aws 

themselves, whether made with or without our consent, if they regulate 

and constrain our conduct in matters of mere indifference, without any 

good end in view, are laws destructive of our liberty." 308 Rights therefore 

play a fundamental role in the Commentaries, and help support the natural 

law test of reason even in matters indifferent according to the more 

limited reach of explicit natural law precepts. 

And Blackstone does make much of the notion of matters 

indifferent, a mark of Hooker's theology and the Anglican tradition. 309 

His frequent use of the test of reasonableness supplies a natural law 

standard in the absence of precise precepts themselves drawn from 

nature. 310 In a sense then, the Commentaries presents most human law as 

prescribing rules for matters indifferent. 311 In another sense, however, 

Blackstone's insistence upon the reasonableness of human law supplies a 

standard and justification much like that of the Roman law, a standard 

and justification from natural law assuring that human law is suited to 

the reality of things. 312 

The reality of things can become clouded by human artifice, so the 

primitive state -and primitive law -offer a useful corrective. 313 For 

Blackstone, Saxon law stood for law based upon reason, not authority, 314 

306 See supra note 240 and accompanying text. 
307 Social contract theory plays a role in Blackstone's development of natural law, see Finnis,

with Hart's view. See Finnis, supra note 24, at 171-74.

Again, it bears repeating that "the reality of things" speaks not only of mere physicality 
but also of the norms appropriate to the situation at hand. The reality of things holds as 
much ought as is. See supra notes 66-76 and accompanying text.

he himself esteeming primitive law the most rational and therefore most 

true to nature. 315 The corruption of Saxon law by "Norman subtlety" 316 

left it an ideal to be recovered by progress under the hand of 

Providence. 317 The law is to conform to reason, and Saxon law points the 

way to reasonable law untainted by later human error. 

Likewise, Blackstone's emphasis on the reasonableness of the law 

helps make sense of his theory of judging. A judge is "sworn to determine, 

not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known 

laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but 

to maintain and expound the old one." 318 This declaratory theory of 

judging has come under wide-ranging attack, 319 and some doubt has been 

cast on whether Blackstone himself really subscribed to it. 320 Though 

judges even now may pay lip service to the theory, 321 it may seem unlikely 

that the development of the common law and the decision of difficult 

questions proceed simply from the declaration of pre-existing principles 

and rules, and not from judicial invention. 322 But the matter might be less 

puzzling if, rather than thinking that the theory entails some preexistent 

code of natural-law rules ready to fill gaps in the previously declared

See id. at 83-84; McKnight, supra note 2, at 403; Posner, supra note 45, at 583; cf. MAINE, 
supra note 24, at 60 (noting that Roman lawyers respected the natural law within their own 
law for its "descent from the aboriginal reign of nature"). Presumably, Blackstone melds 
his endorsement of both Saxon primitivism and historical development in the notion of 
sound development upon Saxon principle. 
1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 69; see also 3 id. at 327 ("For though in many other 
countries every thing is left in the breast of the judge to determine, yet with us he is only 
to declare and pronounce, not to make or new-model, the law"). This understanding of 
the work of the judge is in keeping with Blackstone's view of the use of reason in law to 
discover, not to invent. See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 51, 123. So law apparently created by 
human beings has also a divine quality. Id. at 59.

At the same time, however, Helmholz has noted the traditional role for natural law in 
adjudging cases, Helmholz, supra note 55, at 18, and one may wonder how the rule of law 
could be respected were judges to invent rules to apply to cases before them but arising 
from facts long past. See STEVEN D. SMITH, LAW'S QUANDARY 61-64 (2004).

common law, one could see instead that the question in any case is 

governed either by principles marked in precedent or by whichever of the 

rules proposed by the parties is the more reasonable in the light of 

precedent and the facts of the instant case. 323 The judicial resolution of 

otherwise uncertain questions of law demands the application of reason 

and not ex post legislative will. 

As we have seen, Blackstone does take natural law seriously, but in 

an Anglican sense. The common law reflects the natural law, understood 

as the rule of reasonableness, a norm that aligns the law with the realities 

of the situation at hand, much as the Roman law is celebrated for doing so 

well. That is the natural law as the Commentaries most often applies it. 

6. CONCLUSION 

After the spread of the Benthamite positivism, the sense of the 

natural law enterprise was forgotten and (despite the eclipse of 

Bentham's epistemology) it has remained usual to believe that 

the heart of any theory of natural law is, not the problem of the 

varying derivation of positive from natural law, but the thesis 

that positive law is "for all purposes" void if it contradicts 

natural law. Thus Blackstone's introductory discourse and 

definition of municipal law have standardly been interpreted 

on the assumption that any discussion of the relation between 

natural and positive law must be headed for an assertion or 

denial of that crude slogan, lex iniusta non est lex. 324 

323 Apparently, on the bench Blackstone himself adhered to the declaratory theory and 
faithfully applied precedent. See Kadens, supra note 5, at 1556-58, 1578, 1580, 1583, 
1586, 1590, 1598, 1600-01. That Blackstone does not subscribe to judicial review, see 1 
BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 91; Helmholz, supra note 55, at 14, in no way compromises 
his commitment to natural law. Finnis, supra note 24, at 169-70.

Readers of the Commentaries committed to a narrow understanding of 

natural law -often so committed only to reject the concept of natural law 

altogether -find Blackstone at best an epigone of natural law thinkers. 

He pays his natural-law lip service and then goes about his merry (and 

disguised) positivist way. 325 Ignoring the relation of law to morals as well 

as historical normativity, 326 we lack eyes to see Blackstone's use of 

natural law in explaining, justifying, and criticizing English law. 

At the same time, how strange to think that human law somehow 

exists apart from reasons for its existence, reasons that connect it to the 

world it is to govern. Holmes supplies such reasons. 327 Posner supplies 

such reasons. 328 Blackstone does too. His reasons, his general recursion 

to reasonableness, is not simply a platitudinous reference. Within his 

Anglican context, reason and reasonableness are notes of God's order and 

providence. They are notes of natural law. 

The concept of law without values is incoherent. The "reason" and 

"reasonableness" peppering the Commentaries are meant to supply the 

link between the laws of England and the values that developed and 

undergird them. Blackstone's Anglican approach to systematizing and 

explaining English law -the systematizing and explaining that made his 

Commentaries such a success -renders this link a natural-law 

enterprise. 329 And this enterprise should strike lawyers, and especially 

law students, as something familiar. They may not share Blackstone's 

theological commitments, but when they strive to make sense of the rules 

of law, to see the rules as reasonable, to find reasons for the rules, they

Commentaries is a checkerboard of natural law and positivist perspectives").

This approach bears a resemblance to the natural law of Roman law, "smuggling" into 
the law values under the guise of a merely "technological" approach. See D'ENTRÈVES,supra 
note 61, at 151. Also, Lon Fuller's explanation of the development of the common law case-
by-case comes to mind: he described each case presenting to the court the opportunity to 
discern the necessary implications of the enterprise the law at issue is to govern. See Lon

celebrated Commentaries, a course marked by natural law.
