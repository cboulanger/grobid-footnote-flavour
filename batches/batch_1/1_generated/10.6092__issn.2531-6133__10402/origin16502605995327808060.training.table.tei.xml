            <figDesc>The voluntaristic stamp of Blackstone&apos;s law of nature -it is the will of<lb/> God -diminishes somewhat in the next words of the Commentaries.<lb/> God&apos;s wisdom leads him to prescribe only what corresponds to the nature<lb/> of things and in this he conforms to &quot;the eternal, immutable laws of good<lb/> and evil.&quot; 28 Human reason is able to discover these laws, and God&apos;s<lb/> goodness leads him to link our happiness with obedience to the law of<lb/> nature. &quot;For he has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven<lb/> the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the<lb/> latter cannot be obtained but by observing the former; and, if the former<lb/> be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter.&quot; 29 This link between<lb/> the law of nature and human happiness &quot;is the foundation of what we call<lb/> ethics, or natural law.&quot; 30 Natural law comprises articles that &quot;amount to<lb/> </figDesc>
<lb/> 
            <table>no more than demonstrating, that this or that action tends to man&apos;s real<lb/> happiness, and therefore very justly concluding that the performance of it<lb/> is a part of the law of nature.&quot; 31<lb/> Blackstone then renders explicit the supreme authority of the law of<lb/> nature:<lb/> THIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated<lb/> by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other.<lb/> It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times:<lb/> no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such<lb/> of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority,<lb/> mediately or immediately, from this original. 32<lb/> Again, Blackstone&apos;s law of nature brings to mind Aquinas&apos;s natural law. 33<lb/> But Blackstone&apos;s approach to what he calls natural law differs<lb/> profoundly from that of Aquinas.

            <table>Commentaries describes natural law as a set of demonstrations that<lb/> certain human conduct leads to human happiness and consequently<lb/> comports with the law of nature. 34 This description is nothing like<lb/> Aquinas&apos;s description of natural law as the participation of human beings<lb/> in the eternal law, or perhaps vice versa. 35 This difference between<lb/> Blackstone and Aquinas becomes yet clearer in the former&apos;s comparison<lb/> of divine law with natural law.<lb/> Although human reason before the Fall sufficed to discover the<lb/> precepts of the law of nature, human reason after the Fall &quot;is corrupt, and<lb/> [human] understanding full of ignorance and error.&quot; 36 Therefore, God of<lb/> his compassion has informed us of the law of nature &quot;by . . . immediate<lb/> and direct revelation.&quot; 37 &quot;The doctrines thus delivered we call the<lb/> revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy<lb/> scriptures.&quot; 38 So the natural law and the divine law both bespeak the law<lb/> of nature.<lb/> Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is (humanly speaking) of<lb/> infinite more authority than what we generally call the natural<lb/> law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly declared so to<lb/> be by God himself; the other is only what, by the assistance of<lb/> human reason, we imagine to be that law.

Hittinger finds<lb/> that Aquinas, &quot;[i]n his last recorded remarks on the subject of natural law,&quot; said:<lb/> Now although God in creating man gave him this law of nature,<lb/> the devil oversowed another law in man, namely, the law of<lb/> concupiscence. . . .

<lb/> 
            <note>a popular target of criticism. So has Blackstone&apos;s use -or rather non-use<lb/> -of these elements when he develops his commentaries on the laws of<lb/> England proper. Nevertheless, a more liberal appreciation of his work will<lb/> notice a highly developed and broadly used natural law approach in those<lb/> commentaries. This appreciation, however, must be attuned to discerning<lb/> <note>J. Reid, Jr., The Transformation of English Legal Science: From Hale to Blackstone, 45 EMORY<lb/> L.J. 437, 490 n.107 (1996).<lb/> See supra notes 41 and 44 for instances where the Commentaries explicitly draws upon<lb/> specific rules of the law of nature, natural law, or divine law.<lb/> H. L. A. Hart, Blackstone&apos;s Use of the Law of Nature, 1956 BUTTERWORTHS S. AFR. L. REV. 169,<lb/> 169-71.<lb/> See Finnis, supra note 24, at 171-74.<lb/> <note>54 McKnight concurs in Hart&apos;s view of Blackstone&apos;s treatment of the law of nature and sees<lb/> it as making way for Blackstone&apos;s focus on indifferent matters. See McKnight, supra<lb/> note 2, at 405. McKnight&apos;s understanding also supports, if ironically, the argument that<lb/> Blackstone thereby paves the way for his own brand of natural law analysis. See infra notes<lb/> 309-12 and accompanying text.<lb/> Two other criticisms of the Commentaries deserve scant mention here. First, the radical<lb/> critique of Duncan Kennedy, The Structure of Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries, 28 BUFF. L. REV.<lb/> 205 (1979), that finds Blackstone &quot;supremely unconvincing.&quot; Id. at 211. Kennedy&apos;s<lb/> critique itself has been found supremely unconvincing. See, e.g., Alschuler, supra note 1, at<lb/> 45-46; Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 492 n.108; John W. Cairns, Blackstone, an English<lb/> Institutist: Legal Literature and the Rise of the Nation State, 4 OXFORD J. LEGAL STUD. 318,<lb/> 350-52 (1984); Watson, supra note 23, at 795, 802. Second, some commentators criticize<lb/> Blackstone on his discussion of absolute rights, as if his use of &quot;absolute&quot; means incapable<lb/> of diminishment or compromise. See, e.g., </note>
 
            <figDesc>Lobban, supra note 50, at 329-30; McKnight,<lb/> supra note 2, at 401 n.16. This criticism falls aside upon paying more careful attention to<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s usage:<lb/> THE rights of persons considered in their natural capacities are<lb/> also of two sorts, absolute, and relative. Absolute, which are such as<lb/> appertain and belong to particular men, merely as individuals or single<lb/> persons: relative, which are incident to them as members of society,<lb/> and standing in various relations to each other.<lb/> 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 119. &quot;Absolute&quot; means apart from social context, not<lb/> sacrosanct.

            <figDesc>If common law judges in deciding cases were making law up, they were<lb/> making it up to fit. 96<lb/> Blackstone, student of Roman law, reflected a Roman law approach<lb/> to the natural law in the Commentaries. Beginning, like the Digest and<lb/> Institutes of the Corpus Juris Civilis, with an abstract exposition of natural<lb/> law and related formulations, the body of the Commentaries puts natural<lb/> law most to use in explaining and justifying particular rules of law.<lb/> Seeking the dictates of reason and the guide of reasonableness,<lb/> Blackstone rests rules of law upon the nature of the matter at hand -a<lb/> typically Roman technique. In this and other respects, Blackstone&apos;s use of<lb/> natural law fits well with the Anglican stance on natural law that he<lb/> adopts in the Commentaries.</figDesc>

In this context Hooker calls law<lb/> &quot;positive&quot; if express revelation is necessary to know it. 1 HOOKER, supra note 108, at 220<lb/> n.1. Also, apparently unlike Blackstone, Hooker observes that the evidence of the senses<lb/> is clear and strong while that of revelation is complicated and complex. THORNTON, supra,<lb/> at 16.

Against the Puritan threat of<lb/> &quot;singularity,&quot; lack of consensus, 132 Hooker counterpoised consent, 133 a<lb/> distant consent presumed to continue. 134 Custom, modified appropriately<lb/> by customarily legitimate written law, is authoritative and likely to induce<lb/> obedience. 135 This appreciation for custom fits well with Hooker&apos;s view<lb/> that God teaches through human experience. 136<lb/> It also supports<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s hailing custom as the common law, a move that enabled him<lb/> to capture the advantages of both primitive sources and traditional<lb/> developments. 137<lb/> Third is the related matter of Hooker&apos;s use of history. For Hooker,<lb/> Scripture supports the value of experience. 138 Joined with his notion that<lb/> God delivers law providentially, 139 these views support Hooker&apos;s position<lb/> that attaining truth is a gradual affair played out in history. 140 Humans may<lb/> make laws, but in a sense those laws are God&apos;s as he works his providential<lb/> will. 141 History as the unfolding of gradual development 142 is normative<lb/> for Hooker. 143 Consequently, Harold Berman has found in Hooker a key to<lb/> English historical jurisprudence and its continuing influence 144 as well as<lb/> FAULKNER, supra note 111, at 115.<lb/> 131 See infra notes 305-12 and accompanying text. University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> an emphasis on historical continuity. 145 For Blackstone, history is the key<lb/> to understanding English law. 146<lb/> The last marked influence of Hooker on Blackstone is the<lb/> importance of the concept of things indifferent, matters not conclusively<lb/> ordained by transcendent law but rather left more to human<lb/> determination. 147 </table>
 
            <figDesc>Positive laws may resolve matters that God leaves to<lb/> human liberty. 148 So, while some human laws are based upon natural<lb/> law, 149 its necessary tenets are few, leaving most matters to public<lb/> authority. 150 Blackstone takes a similar tack 151 : Daniel Boorstin has<lb/> discussed the remarkable degree to which Blackstone holds that private<lb/> property itself is a creature of civil law. 152 Crimes not mala in se but rather<lb/> those &quot;with regard to things in themselves indifferent . . . become either<lb/> right or wrong, just or unjust, duties or misdemeanors, according as the<lb/> municipal legislator sees proper.&quot; 153 &quot;Lands are not naturally descendible<lb/> any more than thrones: but the law has thought proper, for the benefit<lb/> and peace of the public, to establish hereditary succession in one as well<lb/> See id. at 1666.<lb/> See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 36; LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 42; Conklin, supra note 23,<lb/> at 218. Lobban finds in Blackstone a commitment to authority and history over deductive<lb/> reasoning, see Lobban, supra note 50, at 328, and views the Commentaries as intertwining<lb/> theory with history. Id. at 330. And Boorstin finds a telling example of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> commitment to history in his treatment of the Revolution of 1688. BOORSTIN, supra note 1,<lb/> at 26.<lb/> See ATKINSON, supra note 106, at 59-60.<lb/> See 2 HOOKER, supra note 108, at 363.<lb/> THORNTON, supra note 117, at 32.<lb/> See FAULKNER, supra note 111, at 113; see also id. at 100 (observing that, after the law<lb/> of reason, human law holds prominence for Hooker), 112 (observing that, once natural<lb/> necessity calls for a rule, nearly any rule will do).<lb/> 151 While for Blackstone &quot;indifferent&quot; can mean diverse things, Finnis, supra note 24,<lb/> at 172-73, Blackstone imitates Hooker on biblical law, for example, acceding to its<lb/> authority but finding its still-obligatory moral law pertinent to very few issues. See<lb/> D. SEABORN DAVIES, THE BIBLE IN ENGLISH LAW 20 (1954). As to one such instance, it is<lb/> both intriguing and relevant to note that Blackstone observes that blood guilt-a concept<lb/> harking back to biblical standards-would adhere to Parliament were it to over-extend<lb/> capital punishment. 4 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 11. The Bible also speaks specifically<lb/> of blood guilt for over-extension of capital punishment. See DEUTERONOMY 19:4-10. See<lb/> generally Craig A. Stern, Torah and Murder: The Cities of Refuge and Anglo-American Law,<lb/> 35 VAL. U. L.
