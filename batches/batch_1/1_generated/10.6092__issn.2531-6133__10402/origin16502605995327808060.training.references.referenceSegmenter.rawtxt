307 Social contract theory plays a role in Blackstone's development of natural law, see Finnis, 
supra note 24, at 178-79, and even property rights are contingent, developed in the context 
of society, see supra note 152 and accompanying text; Allen, supra note 21, at 197. Natural 
liberty yields to social convention, but only for good reasons.

See Finnis, supra note 24, at 181; David Lemmings, Editor's Introduction to Book I of 1 
BLACKSTONE, supra note 2, at xvii, xxxi. H.L.A. Hart has suggested that Blackstone's 
presentation of natural law is expressly to provide gaps to be filled by human law settling 
matters indifferent, Hart, supra note 52, at 174, but Finnis has demonstrated the difficulty 
with Hart's view. See Finnis, supra note 24, at 171-74.

Again, it bears repeating that "the reality of things" speaks not only of mere physicality 
but also of the norms appropriate to the situation at hand. The reality of things holds as 
much ought as is. See supra notes 66-76 and accompanying text.
