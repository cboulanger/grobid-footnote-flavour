	ABSTRACT:
	<div type="abstract">It is said that no book on the common law surpasses the importance of Sir<lb/> William Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries on the Laws of England. But it is also said that the<lb/> Commentaries is of questionable merit, with aspects of it downright incoherent. The most<lb/> fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this disparaging characterization is<lb/> its discussion and use of what it usually calls &quot;the law of nature&quot; -and what we these<lb/> days usually call &quot;natural law.&quot; Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually<lb/> many mistakes -of natural law? This article answers that it is not the Commentaries, but<lb/> rather its critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from the<lb/> expectation that Blackstone&apos;s natural law would take after Thomas Aquinas&apos;s (or even<lb/> Christopher St. German&apos;s) natural law. But readers of the Commentaries who allow<lb/> Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable treatment that animates<lb/> the whole. Blackstone&apos;s natural law owes much to two influences, Roman law and the<lb/> Anglican Church. The second influence is the more distinctive and guides Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural law as an order immanent in<lb/> human law, an order especially prominent within the common law. Seen in this light,<lb/> natural law provides the foundation for the Commentaries and a foundation for<lb/> understanding law in our own day.<lb/></div>
