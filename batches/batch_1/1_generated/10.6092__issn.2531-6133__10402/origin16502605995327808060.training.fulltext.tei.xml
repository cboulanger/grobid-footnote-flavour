			<p>&quot;[P]erhaps the most important single book . . . in the history of the<lb/> common law&quot; is Sir William Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries on the Laws of<lb/> England (hereinafter Commentaries). <ref type="biblio">1</ref> No other book but the Bible had a<lb/> greater role in generating American institutions 2 and the nineteenth<lb/> century alone saw about one hundred American versions. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> It is said that<lb/> the Commentaries led early American courts to decide from principles, not<lb/> precedents. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> But it is said also that the Commentaries is of questionable<lb/> merit, 5 with aspects of it downright incoherent. <ref type="biblio">6<lb/></ref> The most fundamental element of the Commentaries to attract this<lb/> disparaging characterization is its discussion and use of what it usually<lb/> calls &quot;the law of nature.&quot; 7 &quot;Natural law&quot; is the term more frequently used<lb/> these days for a transcendent legal order to which human law necessarily<lb/> bears some relationship.

The present article<lb/> happens to highlight elements of the Commentaries that commended it to Americans<lb/> of the Founding: &quot;Even those who rejected Blackstone&apos;s anti-republican emphasis on<lb/> parliamentary omnipotence . . . had no difficulty in accepting the validity of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> exposition of English common law as founded on custom, divine law, and the law of<lb/> nature, hence providing an entirely appropriate legal foundation for the incipient USA.&quot;<lb/> Wilfrid Prest, General Editor&apos;s Introduction to 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES ON THE<lb/> LAWS OF ENGLAND, at vii, xiv (Wilfrid Prest ed., Oxford Univ.

On the other<lb/> hand, Aquinas seems to do likewise.</p>

			<p>often will use the latter term instead. In this parlance, the concern<lb/> becomes the charge of incoherence in Blackstone&apos;s discussion and use of<lb/> natural law. Does the Commentaries perpetrate a mistake -actually many<lb/> mistakes -of natural law?<lb/></p>

			<p>This article proposes that it is not the Commentaries, but rather its<lb/> critics that perpetrate mistakes of natural law. The mistakes arise from<lb/> the expectation that Blackstone&apos;s natural law would take after Thomas<lb/> Aquinas&apos;s 8 (or even Christopher St.German&apos;s) 9 natural law. As Blackstone<lb/> disappoints these expectations, he has met with criticisms that his<lb/> treatment of natural law is a sloppy pro forma performance that even he<lb/> himself does not take seriously. But readers of the Commentaries who<lb/> allow Blackstone his own way with natural law will find it a valuable<lb/> treatment that animates the whole of the Commentaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone&apos;s natural law owes much to two influences. The first is<lb/> Roman law, especially as captured in the Corpus Juris Civilis. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> The second<lb/> is the Anglican church, <ref type="biblio">11</ref> which is the more distinctive and guides<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s response to the first. Both led Blackstone to view the natural<lb/> law as an order immanent in human law, an order especially prominent<lb/> within the common law. Seen in this light, natural law provides the<lb/> foundation for the Commentaries. While doing so, it also provides a<lb/> foundation for understanding law even today, a foundation actually in use<lb/> far more than some might think.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">8</ref> See infra notes 34-44 and accompanying text.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">9</ref> In the early sixteenth century, St. German wrote Doctor and Student, &quot;the first major law<lb/> book published in English,&quot; &quot;also the first purely analytical English law book,&quot; a work<lb/> of &quot;analytical theology and philosophy.</p>

			<p>jumble that was English law. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> This arrangement was a key to its success. <ref type="biblio">22<lb/></ref> It is Blackstone&apos;s use of natural law that undergirds this arrangement. <ref type="biblio">23<lb/></ref> Near the beginning of the Commentaries is Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> introductory discussion of law. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> Law is &quot;a rule of action dictated by some<lb/> superior being,&quot; and laws considered as rules for human conduct are &quot;the<lb/> precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary beings, a creature<lb/> endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded to make use of<lb/> those faculties in the general regulation of his behavior.&quot; <ref type="biblio">25</ref> The obligation<lb/> to obey law derives from dependence upon the lawgiver, &quot;[a]nd<lb/> consequently as man depends absolutely upon his maker for every thing,<lb/> it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his maker&apos;s will.<lb/></p>

			<p>THIS will of his maker is called the law of nature.&quot; <ref type="biblio">26</ref> In its scope,<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s law of nature reminds one of Aquinas&apos;s natural law.</p>

Blackstone&apos;s use of natural law in the Commentaries may also reflect his<lb/> own introduction to the law. It was St. German&apos;s Doctor and Student, a work integrating<lb/> theological and legal thought, that drew Blackstone to the law. Cook, supra note 12, at<lb/> 170.

Therefore it has a share of the Eternal Reason, by which it<lb/> has a natural inclination to its due act and end; and this participation of the eternal law in<lb/> the rational creature is called the natural law . . . [T]he natural law is nothing else than<lb/> the rational creature&apos;s participation of the eternal law&quot;).<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> The voluntaristic stamp of Blackstone&apos;s law of nature -it is the will of<lb/> God -diminishes somewhat in the next words of the Commentaries.<lb/> God&apos;s wisdom leads him to prescribe only what corresponds to the nature<lb/> of things and in this he conforms to &quot;the eternal, immutable laws of good<lb/> and evil.&quot; 28 Human reason is able to discover these laws, and God&apos;s<lb/> goodness leads him to link our happiness with obedience to the law of<lb/> nature. &quot;For he has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven<lb/> the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the<lb/> latter cannot be obtained but by observing the former; and, if the former<lb/> be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter.&quot; 29 This link between<lb/> the law of nature and human happiness &quot;is the foundation of what we call<lb/> ethics, or natural law.&quot; 30 Natural law comprises articles that &quot;amount to<lb/> no more than demonstrating, that this or that action tends to man&apos;s real<lb/> happiness, and therefore very justly concluding that the performance of it<lb/> is a part of the law of nature.&quot; 31<lb/> Blackstone then renders explicit the supreme authority of the law of<lb/> nature:<lb/> THIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated<lb/> by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other.<lb/> It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times:<lb/> no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such<lb/> of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority,<lb/> mediately or immediately, from this original. 32<lb/> Again, Blackstone&apos;s law of nature brings to mind Aquinas&apos;s natural law. 33<lb/> But Blackstone&apos;s approach to what he calls natural law differs<lb/> profoundly from that of Aquinas. We already have noted that the<lb/> 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 40.<lb/> Id.<lb/> Id. at 41.<lb/> 31 Id.<lb/> Id.<lb/> See 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 227-28 (I-II, 95, 2, observing, in an article on the relation<lb/> of &quot;human law&quot; to &quot;natural law,&quot; that &quot;every human law has just so much of the character<lb/> of law as it is derived from the law of nature. But if in any point it differs from the law of<lb/> nature, it is no longer a law but a corruption of law.&quot;).<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> Commentaries describes natural law as a set of demonstrations that<lb/> certain human conduct leads to human happiness and consequently<lb/> comports with the law of nature. 34 This description is nothing like<lb/> Aquinas&apos;s description of natural law as the participation of human beings<lb/> in the eternal law, or perhaps vice versa. 35 This difference between<lb/> Blackstone and Aquinas becomes yet clearer in the former&apos;s comparison<lb/> of divine law with natural law.<lb/> Although human reason before the Fall sufficed to discover the<lb/> precepts of the law of nature, human reason after the Fall &quot;is corrupt, and<lb/> [human] understanding full of ignorance and error.&quot; 36 Therefore, God of<lb/> his compassion has informed us of the law of nature &quot;by . . . immediate<lb/> and direct revelation.&quot; 37 &quot;The doctrines thus delivered we call the<lb/> revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy<lb/> scriptures.&quot; 38 So the natural law and the divine law both bespeak the law<lb/> of nature.<lb/> Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is (humanly speaking) of<lb/> infinite more authority than what we generally call the natural<lb/> law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly declared so to<lb/> be by God himself; the other is only what, by the assistance of<lb/> human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be as<lb/> See supra text accompanying note 31.<lb/> See supra note 27.<lb/> 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 41. For discussions of Aquinas&apos;s approach to the impact<lb/> of the Fall upon the operation of the natural law, see also CHARLES E. RICE, 50 QUESTIONS<lb/> ON THE NATURAL LAW 159-63 (1993) and Russell Hittinger, Natural Law and Catholic Moral<lb/> Philosophy, in A PRESERVING GRACE 1, 7-8 (Michael Cromartie ed., 1997). Hittinger finds<lb/> that Aquinas, &quot;[i]n his last recorded remarks on the subject of natural law,&quot; said:<lb/> Now although God in creating man gave him this law of nature,<lb/> the devil oversowed another law in man, namely, the law of<lb/> concupiscence. . . . Since then the law of nature was destroyed by<lb/> concupiscence, man needed to be brought back to works of virtue, and<lb/> to be drawn away from vice: for which purpose he needed the written<lb/> law.<lb/> Id. at 7 (citing Thomas Aquinas, Collations in Decem Praeceptis (1273)).<lb/> 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 42.<lb/> Id.</figure>

			<p>In tension with his formulation here, elsewhere in the Commentaries Blackstone will<lb/> write of &quot;divine law, either natural or revealed,&quot; 2 id. at 420, and &quot;divine law both natural<lb/> and revealed,&quot; id. at 455. In these two instances, it appears that he uses &quot;divine&quot; to denote<lb/> the divine origin of the law of nature rather than to denote divine law proper. So, in yet<lb/> a third place, he writes of &quot;those laws which the creator has given us; the divine laws, I<lb/> mean, of either nature or revelation.&quot; 4 id. at 177.<lb/></p>

			<p>certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an<lb/> equal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any<lb/> competition together. <ref type="biblio">39<lb/></ref> Natural law is &quot;only what . . . we imagine to be&quot; the law of nature. <ref type="biblio">40<lb/></ref> The Commentaries continues with further observations on the<lb/> relationship between these laws and human law:<lb/></p>

			<p>UPON these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of<lb/> revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human<lb/> laws should be suffered to contradict these. There is, it is true, a<lb/> great number of indifferent points, in which both the divine law<lb/> and the natural leave a man at his own liberty; but which are<lb/> found necessary for the benefit of society to be restrained<lb/> within certain limits. And herein it is that human laws have<lb/> their greatest force and efficacy; for, with regard to such points<lb/> as are not indifferent, human laws are only declaratory of, and<lb/> act in subordination to, the former. <ref type="biblio">41<lb/></ref> Two elements of this excerpt warrant special notice. First is Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> usage of the &quot;law of nature&quot; and the &quot;natural law.&quot; As mentioned<lb/> above, 42 his usage sometimes seems to depart from distinguishing the<lb/> two, with natural law as a merely human construct thought to resemble<lb/> the actual law of nature. On one reading, such a departure appears in this<lb/> passage.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second element is the connection between matters<lb/> indifferent -matters for which the law of nature does not prescribe a<lb/> specific rule -and human law. While there is a firm link between the<lb/> laws of nature and human law, it appears that human law largely<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">1 id. at 42.<lb/> Id.<lb/> Id. Examples of Blackstone&apos;s references to the divine law include his discussion of the law<lb/> of nuisance as enforcing &quot;that excellent rule of gospel-morality, of &apos;doing to others as we<lb/> would they should do unto ourselves,&apos;&quot; 3 id. at 218, and of the criminal law, 4 id. at 11, 30,<lb/> 42, 43, 60, including laws against homicide, id. at 177, dueling, id. at 199, and sodomy,<lb/> id. at 216. John Finnis has noted that Blackstone&apos;s endorsement of the role divine law is<lb/> to play in the formulation of human law does not lead him to confuse crime with sin. See<lb/> Finnis, supra note 24, at 177.<lb/> See supra note 7.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> concerns itself with matters indifferent. Whereas Aquinas casts human<lb/> law essentially in the position of providing determinations that apply<lb/> rules of the natural law in particular contexts, 43 Blackstone sees human<lb/> law having greatest play where the law of nature appears mute. This<lb/> significant role in his analysis for things indifferent owes a major debt to<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s Anglican point of view. 44<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s introductory remarks on law and their relation to the<lb/> rest of the Commentaries (and, for that matter, Blackstone&apos;s entire<lb/> project) have drawn sharp criticism. It is reported that no less an<lb/> authority than Dr. Johnson remarked that Blackstone &quot;thought clearly,<lb/> but he thought faintly.&quot; 45 The Commentaries &quot;is widely believed to rest on<lb/> silly, ponderous, formal, conceptual, outdated, deductive, mechanistic,<lb/> naive and hopelessly unrealistic jurisprudence,&quot; 46 to be lacking in rigor, 47<lb/></figure>

			<p>and apparently riven by inconsistencies. <ref type="biblio">48</ref> Especially for his effort to<lb/> satisfy the customary requirement of supplying his treatise with a general<lb/> introduction on the law, <ref type="biblio">49</ref> Blackstone has received much criticism. <ref type="biblio">50<lb/></ref> Beyond this, Blackstone seems largely to ignore the introductory doctrine<lb/> See 2 AQUINAS, supra note 27, at 209-10 (I-II, 91, 3, observing that, &quot;it is from the precepts<lb/> of the natural law, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that the human reason<lb/> needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular<lb/> determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws . . .&quot;). The Commentaries<lb/> is not wholly lacking this approach. For example: &quot;And sometimes, where the thing itself<lb/> has it&apos;s [sic] rise from the law of nature, the particular circumstances and mode of doing<lb/> it become right or wrong, as the laws of the land shall direct.&quot; 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note<lb/> 23, at 55.<lb/> The significant role in the Commentaries for human law to supply rules for matters<lb/> indifferent does not preclude a role for the law of nature (or natural law) in supplying<lb/> specific rules for human law.</p>

The early classic effort to debunk the<lb/> Commentaries is JEREMY BENTHAM, A FRAGMENT ON GOVERNMENT (London, Thomas Payne<lb/> et al. 1776), but Bentham&apos;s target is as much the notion of natural law as the Commentaries<lb/> itself. Posner&apos;s article explains that Bentham&apos;s is a &quot;fundamentally misconceived attack<lb/> on the Commentaries.&quot; Id. at 569.<lb/> Alschuler, supra note 1, at 2.<lb/> See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 189.<lb/> See Posner, supra note 45, at 571.<lb/> See McKnight, supra note 2, at 402.<lb/> See Michael Lobban, Blackstone and the Science of Law, 30 HIST.

Hart has argued<lb/> that Blackstone does not use the law of nature to support English law, and<lb/> that his natural law test of the validity of positive law is vacuous in any<lb/> event. 52 Although these arguments have not gone unanswered, 53 they<lb/> actually point not to defects but rather to the very natural law technique<lb/> Blackstone uses in his discussion of English law in the Commentaries, the<lb/> technique based upon his Anglican understanding. 54<lb/> The Commentaries has suffered at the hands of some commentators.<lb/> The introductory explanation of the law of nature and natural law has been<lb/> a popular target of criticism. So has Blackstone&apos;s use -or rather non-use<lb/> -of these elements when he develops his commentaries on the laws of<lb/> England proper. Nevertheless, a more liberal appreciation of his work will<lb/> notice a highly developed and broadly used natural law approach in those<lb/> commentaries. This appreciation, however, must be attuned to discerning<lb/> J. Reid, Jr., The Transformation of English Legal Science: From Hale to Blackstone, 45 EMORY<lb/> L.J. 437, 490 n.107 (1996).<lb/> See supra notes 41 and 44 for instances where the Commentaries explicitly draws upon<lb/> specific rules of the law of nature, natural law, or divine law.<lb/> H.

See McKnight, supra<lb/> note 2, at 405. McKnight&apos;s understanding also supports, if ironically, the argument that<lb/> Blackstone thereby paves the way for his own brand of natural law analysis. See infra notes<lb/> 309-12 and accompanying text.<lb/> Two other criticisms of the Commentaries deserve scant mention here. First, the radical<lb/> critique of Duncan Kennedy, The Structure of Blackstone&apos;s Commentaries, 28 BUFF. L. REV.<lb/> 205 (1979), that finds Blackstone &quot;supremely unconvincing.&quot; Id. at 211. Kennedy&apos;s<lb/> critique itself has been found supremely unconvincing. See, e.g., Alschuler, supra note 1, at<lb/> 45-46; Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 492 n.108; John W. Cairns, Blackstone, an English<lb/> Institutist: Legal Literature and the Rise of the Nation State, 4 OXFORD J. LEGAL STUD. 318,<lb/> 350-52 (1984); Watson, supra note 23, at 795, 802. Second, some commentators criticize<lb/> Blackstone on his discussion of absolute rights, as if his use of &quot;absolute&quot; means incapable<lb/> of diminishment or compromise. See, e.g., Lobban, supra note 50, at 329-30; McKnight,<lb/> supra note 2, at 401 n.16. This criticism falls aside upon paying more careful attention to<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s usage:<lb/> THE rights of persons considered in their natural capacities are<lb/> also of two sorts, absolute, and relative. Absolute, which are such as<lb/> appertain and belong to particular men, merely as individuals or single<lb/> persons: relative, which are incident to them as members of society,<lb/> and standing in various relations to each other.<lb/> 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 119. &quot;Absolute&quot; means apart from social context, not<lb/> sacrosanct.

			<head>3. BLACKSTONE AND JUSTINIAN<lb/></head>

			<p>Before seeing Blackstone as an Anglican it helps to see him as a civilian -<lb/>a master of the Corpus Juris Civilis, the body of Roman law assembled<lb/> under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the early sixth century. <ref type="biblio">55<lb/></ref> Blackstone&apos;s own studies at Oxford made him well acquainted with<lb/> Roman law. <ref type="biblio">56</ref> This acquaintance primed him for cultivating his Anglican<lb/> approach to the natural law, an approach that ends up looking very much<lb/> like that of Justinian.<lb/></p>

			<p>As noted already, the Commentaries presents the laws of England<lb/> primarily as a body of substantive law. <ref type="biblio">57<lb/></ref> This approach enabled<lb/> Blackstone to present the laws as a system, arranging them conceptually<lb/> by categories. <ref type="biblio">58</ref> In this, the Commentaries resembles the Roman law<lb/> treatises of the ancient jurisconsult Gaius and of Justinian, whose<lb/></p>

Others have written that Blackstone&apos;s work is<lb/> fundamentally unlike Justinian&apos;s, Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 492-96, or failed<lb/> fundamentally by forcing the content of the common law into an unwelcoming structure<lb/> from Roman law. Lobban, supra note 50, at 312, 321-23.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> Like the Commentaries, the Corpus Juris Civilis presents abstract<lb/> introductory discussions of natural law 61 and manifests its actual use of<lb/> natural law in the body of the work, the treatment of the law of Rome.<lb/> Drawing on the universal and supreme authority of natural law, Justinian<lb/> used it to support and explain Roman law. Intent on promulgating law for<lb/> the entire Roman world, Justinian hoped to justify Roman law as<lb/> universal by demonstrating that it reflected universal principles of law. Of<lb/> course, the Emperor looked to support his own legal regime, not to supply<lb/> arguments to criticize or attack it. The dignity and universal authority of<lb/> the natural law lay ready to lend dignity and universal authority to Roman<lb/> law. 62<lb/></figure>

			<p>Beyond lending this support, the natural law helped explain the<lb/> rules of Roman law. Natural and Roman law were viewed as intertwined,<lb/> so much so that natural law was best seen through existing Roman law,<lb/> the celebrated simplicity and harmony of which derived from this<lb/> relationship. <ref type="biblio">63</ref> As in classical Greek thought on natural law, natural law<lb/> was understood to be from the &quot;aboriginal design of nature,&quot; but Roman<lb/> thinking also understood actual, positive Roman law to approximate the<lb/> ideal natural law, gradually conforming to it more fully. <ref type="biblio">64</ref> Far from a<lb/> revolutionary doctrine, the Roman natural law approach encouraged<lb/> Roman lawyers to find the natural law in positive law. <ref type="biblio">65<lb/></ref> In actual operation, Roman natural law concerned itself with<lb/> conforming legal rules to the nature of things. <ref type="biblio">66</ref> It sought the intrinsic<lb/> character of legal subjects, applying natural reason to the facts of the<lb/></p>

			<p>Roman law, developed in light of this natural law. <ref type="biblio">79<lb/></ref> The Commentaries holds many instances where Blackstone<lb/> explicitly explains that English law is true to the nature of things -<lb/>sometimes presented as fulfilling the obligation of the law to reflect<lb/> &quot;necessity.&quot; This, after he notes that the law of nature inheres in the<lb/> nature of things, 80 and that sound Roman laws took &quot;the nature of things<lb/> for their guide.&quot; 81 Some examples: Blackstone establishes the obligation<lb/> of allegiance to civil government upon the nature of civil government. <ref type="biblio">82<lb/></ref> The legal relationship between husband and wife is founded in nature. <ref type="biblio">83<lb/></ref> Necessity has given rise to the law of property, 84 and laws on personal<lb/> property take into account their transitory nature. <ref type="biblio">85</ref> The laws of civil<lb/> wrongs derive in several respects from the nature of things, often human<lb/> nature, 86 and criminal laws likewise derive from the nature of things or<lb/> reflect the nature of things. <ref type="biblio">87</ref> In these instances, Blackstone seems to<lb/> hark back to the Roman law, rooted as it was in the nature of things.<lb/></p>

			<p>Roman law makes its appearance in the Commentaries in at least<lb/> two other general ways that support Blackstone&apos;s Anglican approach to<lb/> the law. First is its concept of the jus gentium, the law of nations. If the<lb/> natural law truly is universal, one would expect it -or projections from it<lb/> -to be found in the laws of all nations. The law of nations, understood as<lb/> the body of laws to be found widespread among the nations of the earth,<lb/> therefore becomes a window on natural law, as the Romans believed. <ref type="biblio">88<lb/></ref> The Commentaries suggests that natural law inheres in the nature of things in such<lb/> language as, &quot;when the supreme being formed the universe, and created matter out<lb/> of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter, from which it can never<lb/> depart, and without which it would cease to be.</p>

			<figure type="table">&quot; 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 38. If<lb/> Blackstone tags the law of property as governing things indifferent, see infra note 152 and<lb/> accompanying text, he does not thereby hold that property law is wholly without natural<lb/> law principles. See infra notes 309-12 and accompanying text.<lb/> See 1 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 40.<lb/> 81 See id. at 58.<lb/> Id. at 354, 358.<lb/> See id. at 410.<lb/> See 2 id. at 4, 7.<lb/> See 3 id. at 146.<lb/> See id. at 4, 22, 116, 379, 434.<lb/> See 4 id. at 20-21, 27, 74, 186, 216.<lb/> See D&apos;ENTRÃˆVES, supra note 61, at 32-33; MAINE, supra note 24, at 46; NICHOLAS, supra note<lb/> 66, at 55.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>This value of the jus gentium is evident in Blackstone&apos;s use of<lb/> comparative law. He looks to law outside England not so much to<lb/> disparage non-English law as to find points of commonality. Those<lb/> points support English law by suggesting that it rests upon natural law<lb/> foundations. <ref type="biblio">89</ref> A similar cast in Anglican theology could therefore offer a<lb/> link and support to Blackstone&apos;s approach to the law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beyond its content, another aspect of Roman law that influenced<lb/> the Commentaries and would harmonize well with an Anglican<lb/> understanding of the law is the process of the development of Roman law.<lb/></p>

			<p>Roman law developed over hundreds of years, largely case by case. <ref type="biblio">90</ref> In<lb/> this respect, its development paralleled that of English common law.<lb/></p>

			<head>While Roman law came to repose nearly exclusively in the Corpus Juris<lb/></head>

			<p>Civilis, <ref type="biblio">91</ref> English law rejected such codification in favor of its commitment<lb/> to the method by which Roman law developed. <ref type="biblio">92</ref> Some have noted that<lb/> Blackstone took the view of a practicing lawyer and judge in the<lb/> Commentaries, <ref type="biblio">93</ref> and though it was famously said that, &quot;In England less<lb/> attention is paid to natural law than anywhere else in the world,&quot; <ref type="biblio">94<lb/></ref> Blackstone used natural law arguments successfully at the bar. <ref type="biblio">95</ref> The<lb/> common law -the law of cases -required barristers and judges to<lb/> consider cases with an eye to their context. This technique largely<lb/> provided the materials Blackstone assembled in the Commentaries. It is a<lb/> technique that befits the Anglican way, a technique that developed law<lb/> that itself befits the Anglican way. It also was the way of Roman lawyers.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">See infra notes 279-89 and accompanying text.<lb/> See NICHOLAS, supra note 66, at 28-32.<lb/> 91 See 2 EDWARD GIBBON, THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 80 (Encyclopaedia<lb/> Britannica Inc. 1952) (1788).<lb/> See 2 FREDERICK POLLOCK &amp; FREDERIC WILLIAM MAITLAND, THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW<lb/> BEFORE THE TIME OF EDWARD I 585 (Liberty Fund, Inc. 2010) (1898). So the English were<lb/> &quot;more Roman than the Romanists,&quot; those who received as authority the Corpus Juris Civilis<lb/> rather than adhering to the method by which Roman law developed. Id. at 705.<lb/> See Berman &amp; Reid, supra note 50, at 503. But see infra note 235.<lb/> Helmholz , supra note 55, at 20; see also D&apos;ENTRÃˆVES, supra note 61, at 119 n.1.<lb/> McKnight, supra note 2, at 407-09.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> If common law judges in deciding cases were making law up, they were<lb/> making it up to fit. 96<lb/> Blackstone, student of Roman law, reflected a Roman law approach<lb/> to the natural law in the Commentaries. Beginning, like the Digest and<lb/> Institutes of the Corpus Juris Civilis, with an abstract exposition of natural<lb/> law and related formulations, the body of the Commentaries puts natural<lb/> law most to use in explaining and justifying particular rules of law.<lb/> Seeking the dictates of reason and the guide of reasonableness,<lb/> Blackstone rests rules of law upon the nature of the matter at hand -a<lb/> typically Roman technique. In this and other respects, Blackstone&apos;s use of<lb/> natural law fits well with the Anglican stance on natural law that he<lb/> adopts in the Commentaries.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4. BLACKSTONE AND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND<lb/></head>

			<figure type="table">No surprise that Sir William Blackstone, Oxford don, justice of both the<lb/> King&apos;s Bench and Common Pleas, was an Anglican. What may surprise is<lb/> how serious an Anglican Blackstone was, and how deeply his Anglicanism<lb/> influenced the jurisprudence of his Commentaries.<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s deep and pervasive Christian faith was manifest. 97 As<lb/> a young man he took a serious interest in religion, 98 and made a careful<lb/> investigation<lb/> of<lb/> Anglicanism 99<lb/> before<lb/> committing<lb/> himself<lb/> wholeheartedly to orthodox Anglicanism. 100<lb/> He celebrated his<lb/> commitment in a poem, a vision of diverse faiths in which he praised the<lb/> Church of England for its moderation, liberty, support of science,<lb/> See Milsom, supra note 18, at 11-12. Milsom here speaks of fit according to patterns of legal<lb/> rules, but the notion of judges in a sense creating rules that at the same time are seen as<lb/> compelled by antecedent norms is apropos.<lb/> See Cook, supra note 12, at 169.<lb/> See Prest, supra note 58, at 163.<lb/> See Cook, supra note 12, at 174.<lb/> 100 See PREST, supra note 1, at 309; Prest, supra note 3, at 123; Prest, supra note 58, at 161.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> reforming influence, and virtue. 101 Although a committed Anglican,<lb/> Blackstone was not so committed that he could brook no Dissenters, 102<lb/> going so far as to alter the Commentaries in light of Dissenter reaction to<lb/> an earlier edition of the work. 103 The general Anglican understanding of<lb/> providential development from primitive sources 104 and the important<lb/> role reason plays in perceiving truth 105 would support Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> construction of the Commentaries.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Key to the Church of England is the work of the Elizabethan divine,<lb/> Richard Hooker. <ref type="biblio">106</ref> Beyond helping to shape the contours of Anglicanism<lb/> as a whole, Hooker&apos;s influence on legal theory was especially<lb/> pronounced. <ref type="biblio">107<lb/></ref> Blackstone&apos;s Anglican understanding of the law<lb/> necessarily reflects Hooker&apos;s understanding.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hooker held law in high esteem:<lb/></p>

			<p>[O]f Law there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat is<lb/> the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world: all things<lb/> in heaven and in earth do her homage, the very least as feeling<lb/> her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power: both<lb/></p>

			<p>each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent,<lb/> admiring her as the mother of their peace and joy. <ref type="biblio">108<lb/></ref> Law for Hooker is fundamental. <ref type="biblio">109</ref> Furthermore, his treatment of law is<lb/> no incidental matter but derives from his theology. <ref type="biblio">110</ref> Law, as one might<lb/> gather from the excerpt just quoted, reigns over politics. In this, Hooker<lb/> departs from an Aristotelian view, 111 and follows, as elsewhere, the<lb/> magisterial reformers rather than Augustine or Aquinas. <ref type="biblio">112<lb/></ref> Hooker goes so far as to hold that God himself works according to<lb/> law, <ref type="biblio">113</ref> and for at least one commentator, Hooker holds that God is law. <ref type="biblio">114</ref> A<lb/> famous apothegm of Hooker states that &quot;the being of God is a kind of law<lb/> to his working.&quot; <ref type="biblio">115<lb/></ref> In some respects, Hooker&apos;s general discussion of the fundamental<lb/> types of law adumbrates that of Blackstone. Hooker explains that, in his<lb/> usage, both the law of nature and divine law reveal eternal law to<lb/> humankind. <ref type="biblio">116</ref> At the same time, however, Hooker holds divine law to be<lb/> positive law, a creature of God&apos;s reason and will both, whereas for<lb/> Blackstone it is simply a revelation of the law of nature. <ref type="biblio">117</ref> Likewise,<lb/> Hooker sees some human law as an adaptation of natural law, and other<lb/> human law as an ordinance &quot;merely human,&quot; reasonable and convenient<lb/></p>

In this context Hooker calls law<lb/> &quot;positive&quot; if express revelation is necessary to know it. 1 HOOKER, supra note 108, at 220<lb/> n.1. Also, apparently unlike Blackstone, Hooker observes that the evidence of the senses<lb/> is clear and strong while that of revelation is complicated and complex. THORNTON, supra,<lb/> at 16.

			<p>for the time and place. <ref type="biblio">118</ref> A similar formulation of human law will find its<lb/> way into the Commentaries. <ref type="biblio">119<lb/></ref> The line from Hooker to Blackstone is more clearly traced along<lb/> particular elements to be found in the works of both. One is the role of<lb/> human reason in the development of law. <ref type="biblio">120</ref> Like other Reformation<lb/> theologians, Hooker asserts that Scripture and reason both convey to<lb/> humans the knowledge of God and of his eternal law. 121 &quot;It was part of<lb/> God&apos;s nature to work in an orderly and reasonable way . . . .&quot; 122<lb/></p>

			<p>Consequently, &quot;God&apos;s own creation also worked in an orderly and<lb/> reasonable way,&quot; 123 a way ruled by law. God acts to accomplish his<lb/> &quot;rational purpose.&quot; 124 So for Hooker, the appeal to reason becomes<lb/> key. <ref type="biblio">125</ref> The law of reason is for all humans, 126 endowed as they are with &quot;a<lb/> natural practical wisdom.&quot; 127 Humans find themselves ruled by the law of<lb/> reason, divine law, and human law 128 -the last resting upon rational<lb/> human nature 129 and either resolving &quot;probable matters&quot; or &quot;clarify[ing]<lb/></p>

			<p>See infra notes 305-12 and accompanying text.

Against the Puritan threat of<lb/> &quot;singularity,&quot; lack of consensus, 132 Hooker counterpoised consent, 133 a<lb/> distant consent presumed to continue. 134 Custom, modified appropriately<lb/> by customarily legitimate written law, is authoritative and likely to induce<lb/> obedience. 135 This appreciation for custom fits well with Hooker&apos;s view<lb/> that God teaches through human experience. 136<lb/> It also supports<lb/> Blackstone&apos;s hailing custom as the common law, a move that enabled him<lb/> to capture the advantages of both primitive sources and traditional<lb/> developments. 137<lb/> Third is the related matter of Hooker&apos;s use of history. For Hooker,<lb/> Scripture supports the value of experience. 138 Joined with his notion that<lb/> God delivers law providentially, 139 these views support Hooker&apos;s position<lb/> that attaining truth is a gradual affair played out in history. 140 Humans may<lb/> make laws, but in a sense those laws are God&apos;s as he works his providential<lb/> will. 141 History as the unfolding of gradual development 142 is normative<lb/> for Hooker. 143 Consequently, Harold Berman has found in Hooker a key to<lb/> English historical jurisprudence and its continuing influence 144 as well as<lb/> FAULKNER, supra note 111, at 115.<lb/> 131 See infra notes 305-12 and accompanying text.<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> an emphasis on historical continuity. 145 For Blackstone, history is the key<lb/> to understanding English law. 146<lb/> The last marked influence of Hooker on Blackstone is the<lb/> importance of the concept of things indifferent, matters not conclusively<lb/> ordained by transcendent law but rather left more to human<lb/> determination. 147 Positive laws may resolve matters that God leaves to<lb/> human liberty. 148 So, while some human laws are based upon natural<lb/> law, 149 its necessary tenets are few, leaving most matters to public<lb/> authority. 150 Blackstone takes a similar tack 151 : Daniel Boorstin has<lb/> discussed the remarkable degree to which Blackstone holds that private<lb/> property itself is a creature of civil law. 152 Crimes not mala in se but rather<lb/> those &quot;with regard to things in themselves indifferent . . . become either<lb/> right or wrong, just or unjust, duties or misdemeanors, according as the<lb/> municipal legislator sees proper.&quot; 153 &quot;Lands are not naturally descendible<lb/> any more than thrones: but the law has thought proper, for the benefit<lb/> and peace of the public, to establish hereditary succession in one as well<lb/> See id. at 1666.<lb/> See BOORSTIN, supra note 1, at 36; LIEBERMAN, supra note 15, at 42; Conklin, supra note 23,<lb/> at 218. Lobban finds in Blackstone a commitment to authority and history over deductive<lb/> reasoning, see Lobban, supra note 50, at 328, and views the Commentaries as intertwining<lb/> theory with history. Id. at 330. And Boorstin finds a telling example of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> commitment to history in his treatment of the Revolution of 1688. BOORSTIN, supra note 1,<lb/> at 26.<lb/> See ATKINSON, supra note 106, at 59-60.<lb/> See 2 HOOKER, supra note 108, at 363.<lb/> THORNTON, supra note 117, at 32.<lb/> See FAULKNER, supra note 111, at 113; see also id. at 100 (observing that, after the law<lb/> of reason, human law holds prominence for Hooker), 112 (observing that, once natural<lb/> necessity calls for a rule, nearly any rule will do).<lb/> 151 While for Blackstone &quot;indifferent&quot; can mean diverse things, Finnis, supra note 24,<lb/> at 172-73, Blackstone imitates Hooker on biblical law, for example, acceding to its<lb/> authority but finding its still-obligatory moral law pertinent to very few issues. See<lb/> D. SEABORN DAVIES, THE BIBLE IN ENGLISH LAW 20 (1954). As to one such instance, it is<lb/> both intriguing and relevant to note that Blackstone observes that blood guilt-a concept<lb/> harking back to biblical standards-would adhere to Parliament were it to over-extend<lb/> capital punishment. 4 BLACKSTONE, supra note 23, at 11. The Bible also speaks specifically<lb/> of blood guilt for over-extension of capital punishment. See DEUTERONOMY 19:4-10. See<lb/> generally Craig A. Stern, Torah and Murder: The Cities of Refuge and Anglo-American Law,<lb/> 35 VAL. U. L.

			<head>4.2. THE LATITUDINARIANS<lb/></head>

			<p>The Anglican Church faced the Age of Reason and Deism with<lb/> Latitudinarianism. <ref type="biblio">166<lb/></ref> Though standing in opposition to those two<lb/> developments, the Latitudinarians, as their name implies, embraced<lb/> tolerance as their major theme. <ref type="biblio">167</ref> This theme in no way compromised<lb/> their commitment to God and the Christian faith. The Latitudinarians<lb/> believed that God holds an absolute claim on humanity and that all our<lb/> powers depend upon his will. <ref type="biblio">168</ref></p>

 Christianity is to govern all of life. 169<lb/> Education for moral and spiritual reformation is especially important. 170<lb/> With these tenets Latitudinarianism was a major force in seventeenth<lb/> century Anglicanism.<lb/> It also was in important respects a movement in continuity with<lb/> the work of Hooker, a continuity that would support the work of<lb/> Blackstone. The Latitudinarians in their tolerance relied upon Hooker&apos;s<lb/> emphasis on things indifferent. 171<lb/> They also shared Hooker&apos;s<lb/> endorsement of strong laws. 172<lb/> Beyond these particulars, the most important influence of<lb/> Latitudinarianism to be seen in the Commentaries, and well within the<lb/> trajectory Hooker set for the Anglican Church, was its appreciation for<lb/> reason as a guide in human affairs. Latitudinarian thought was well<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> suited to the development of science 173 : it is no accident that Isaac<lb/> Newton was an Anglican. 174 The Latitudinarians understood that human<lb/> reason did not survive the Fall unimpaired. 175 At the same time, however,<lb/> some power of human reason persists. 176 Human reason under God is able<lb/> to understand nature, itself existing under the Sovereign God. 177 This<lb/> human reason is not the reason of rationalism, but instead more like<lb/> common sense. 178 And just as reason is an aid to understanding the<lb/> Bible, 179 so is the Bible a necessary aid to the use of reason. 180<lb/> Latitudinarians favored reason and the philosophical explanation of<lb/> reality, 181 but more important to Blackstone&apos;s jurisprudence was their<lb/> view that reason was useful especially for discerning natural law. 182<lb/> One who could be viewed as the leading exponent of<lb/> Latitudinarianism in the next century, the century of Blackstone, is<lb/> Bishop Joseph Butler. 183 Butler published his most important work, The<lb/> Analogy of Religion Natural and Revealed, in 1736 and it became hugely<lb/> influential in the middle of the century during the height of Blackstone&apos;s<lb/> career and the writing of the Commentaries. 184 Relying on the same<lb/> principles that served Hooker, 185 Butler aimed to refute the deists on the<lb/> grounds of natural theology. 186<lb/> As Blackstone would argue, 187 the<lb/> See James R. Jacob &amp; Margaret C. Jacob, The Anglican Origins of Modern Science: The<lb/> Metaphysical Foundations of the Whig Constitution, 71 ISIS 251, 258 (1980); SPELLMAN, supra<lb/> note 166, at 6-7.<lb/> See Jacob &amp; Jacob, supra note 173, at 254, 262, 265. The Anglican mix of authority from the<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>reasonableness as a touchstone of truth, 210 and common sense coupled<lb/> with experience. <ref type="biblio">211</ref> The large role in the Commentaries played by history<lb/> may be ascribed, at least in part, to this regard for experience. <ref type="biblio">212<lb/></ref> A second aspect of Butler&apos;s theology that helped shape the<lb/> Commentaries is the importance and function of human happiness. <ref type="biblio">213</ref> God<lb/> governs mankind by reward, by the consequences of human actions. <ref type="biblio">214<lb/></ref> Therefore, true happiness directs us towards doing God&apos;s will. <ref type="biblio">215</ref> This<lb/> happiness (supplemented by conscience 216 ) defies certain demonstration,<lb/> but does make itself known with &quot;practical proof.&quot; <ref type="biblio">217</ref> To pursue virtue is<lb/> to pursue happiness, and to pursue happiness is to pursue virtue. <ref type="biblio">218<lb/></ref> Again, Blackstone concurs with Butler in his argument that God has<lb/> ordered human affairs so that we need only pursue our own happiness to<lb/> find ourselves pursuing the law of nature that God has established for the<lb/> right ordering of our affairs. <ref type="biblio">219</ref> For both Butler and Blackstone, reasonable<lb/> self-love motivates us to adhere to God&apos;s rule. <ref type="biblio">220</ref></p>

 So here too, Blackstone<lb/> shows himself in the Commentaries aligning with the work of Butler as he<lb/> aligns with other elements of the Anglican tradition.<lb/> Blackstone had every reason to write the Commentaries from an<lb/> Anglican point of view. It was good rhetoric for reaching his intended<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/> English nation.&quot; 239 Taking liberty as the signal English virtue led, as we<lb/> shall see, only to emphasizing all the more the importance of natural law<lb/> to the laws of England. 240<lb/></figure>

			<p>The Anglican context lent Blackstone&apos;s natural law an empirical<lb/> cast akin to Sir Isaac Newton&apos;s physics. <ref type="biblio">241</ref> His approach was descriptive,<lb/> not deductive. <ref type="biblio">242</ref> Blackstone was not unaware of the dangers of arguing<lb/> from particular to general, 243 but he nonetheless endorsed the scientific<lb/> approach. <ref type="biblio">244</ref> The Commentaries is a quest for reasonableness, for the<lb/> rational principles -the natural law -undergirding the positive<lb/> particulars of English common law. <ref type="biblio">245</ref> Because law is a rational science,<lb/> natural law suffuses the text. <ref type="biblio">246</ref> In this commitment to empirical science<lb/> for fleshing out the natural law embedded in English law, Blackstone<lb/> treats law much as Butler treated theology.<lb/></p>

			<p>Hooker more than Butler animates Blackstone&apos;s emphasis on<lb/> history, but that emphasis likewise demonstrates an Anglican approach to<lb/> natural law. <ref type="biblio">247</ref> It is in progressive human experience that Providence<lb/> gradually works the natural law into human law. <ref type="biblio">248</ref> As with Burke&apos;s view,<lb/> natural law makes itself known in history. <ref type="biblio">249</ref></p>

 But history is no sure<lb/> University of Bologna Law Review<lb/> [Vol.4:2 2019]<lb/> https://doi.org/10.6092/issn.2531-6133/10402<lb/></figure>

			<p>it has, lest we should be tempted to think it of more than<lb/> human structure: defects, chiefly arising from the decays of<lb/> time, or the rage of unskilful [sic] improvements in later ages.<lb/></p>

			<p>To sustain, to repair, to beautify this noble pile, is a charge<lb/> intrusted principally to the nobility, and such gentlemen of the<lb/> kingdom, as are delegated by their country to parliament. The<lb/> protection of THE LIBERTY OF BRITAIN is a duty which they<lb/> owe to themselves, who enjoy it; to their ancestors, who<lb/> transmitted it down; and to their posterity, who will claim at<lb/> their hands this, the best birthright, and noblest inheritance of<lb/> mankind. <ref type="biblio">260<lb/></ref> As the common law embodies and expresses the natural law, it is to be<lb/> reformed when lapses from that transcendent standard appear.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blackstone calls English law of &quot;human structure.&quot;<lb/> Though<lb/> eighteenth-century English lawyers may have called their law &quot;the<lb/> perfection of reason,&quot; 261 Blackstone acknowledges it to be a somewhat<lb/> faulty human application of natural law, 262 sometimes more honored in<lb/> the breach. <ref type="biblio">263<lb/></ref> One means of developing the law with both Anglican continuity<lb/> and an eye to the principles of natural law is by legal fiction. <ref type="biblio">264<lb/></ref> Blackstone held that legal fictions permit the law to do justice in changed<lb/> circumstances, <ref type="biblio">265</ref> as in bypassing Norman errors. <ref type="biblio">266<lb/></ref> In the<lb/> Commentaries, fictions, along with history, ground the law. <ref type="biblio">267</ref></p>
